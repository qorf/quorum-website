You can select the output block and select the left arrow to type return where output is. When the program is run, the text is saved in a variable. At the end of the CompareNumbers action, the call <code>return result</code> returns the text to Main where it is stored in a variable and output. In programming, there are often many ways to solve a problem. This one is a little more general-purpose than the previous solution. Using a return type often allows a programmer to reuse an action for more than one way.</p>",
