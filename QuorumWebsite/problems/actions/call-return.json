Read the action signature, <code>action IceCreamConeRating(text flavor, integer scoops) returns text</code>, to help choose what parameter values to send the action. Do the same thing to help choose which variable to assign the returned value to. Finally, add the output block and change it so it ouputs the value returned from the action.</p>",

Next, replace the two parameters with the variables with the correct types. These types are text and integer. Finally, add the output block and replace the variable name with the same name you used to save the value.</p>",
