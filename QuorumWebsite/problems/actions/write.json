This action will take an integer value representing the number of hours since the zombie has eaten. Then, it will return text describing the zombie's mood. The action will have a signature like the following: <code>action ZombieMood(integer hoursSinceEaten) returns text</code>.</p><p>Inside the action scope, if the number of hours since eating is less than three, return the text &quot;Calm&quot;. If the number of hours is three to six hours, return the text &quot;Hungry&quot;. If it's been more than six hours, return &quot;Raging&quot;.</p><p>Once you have written the action, call the action three times in Main with the hours set to 2, 6, and 9. Then, output your zombie's mood results. A working program will have an action defined, and the output will match the following program output.</p><p><code>Zombie Mood: Calm<br>Zombie Mood: Hungry<br>Zombie Mood: Raging</code></p>",
