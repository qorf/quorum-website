    "description" : "<p>Over this and the next few problems you will work to build up a program that calculates central tendencies for two columns of data located in the <a href=https://quorumlanguage.com/data/covid19.csv>covid19.csv</a> file(originally from the <a href=https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Weekly-Pfizer-Allocations/sxbq-3sid>CDC website</a>).</p><p>For this problem, focus on calculating the standard deviation for the 1st Dose Allocations column. Standard deviation is the amount of variance of the data around the mean. Once you have added the standard deviation action block, run the program. The following is the output you should expect to get.</p><p><code>Central Tendencies of the following Column: 1st Dose Allocations<br>Mean: 62061.63265306125<br>Median: 38025.0<br>Standard Deviation: 81206.03894539685<br>Variance: 0.0<br>Kurtosis: 0.0</code></p>",

    "hint" : "<p>The previous solution has been added to this program so the only calculation you will add is the standard deviation block. Add the standard deviation action block after the select action and before the output blocks. In the next problems, you will calculate the other measures of central tendencies.</p>",
