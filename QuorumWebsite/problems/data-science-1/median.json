Once you have added the median action block, run the program. The following is the output you should expect to get.</p><p><code>Central Tendencies of the following Column: 1st Dose Allocations<br>Mean: 62061.63265306125<br>Median: 38025.0<br>Standard Deviation: 0.0<br>Variance: 0.0<br>Kurtosis: 0.0</code></p>",

    "hint" : "<p>The previous solution has been added to this program so the only calculation you will add is the median block. Add the median action block after the select action and before the output blocks. In the next problems, you will calculate the other measures of central tendencies.</p>",
