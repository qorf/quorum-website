    "description" : "<p>Over this and the next problem, you will work to build up a program that calculates central tendencies for two columns of data located in the <a href=https://quorumlanguage.com/data/covid19.csv>covid19.csv</a> file(originally from the <a href=https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Weekly-Pfizer-Allocations/sxbq-3sid>CDC website</a>).</p><p>For this problem, focus on calculating the kurtosis for the 1st Dose Allocations column. Kurtosis tells how heavily the tails of a distribution differ from the tails of a normal distribution. Once you have added the kurtosis action block, run the program. The following is the output you should expect to get.</p><p><code>Central Tendencies of the following Column: 1st Dose Allocations<br>Mean: 62061.63265306125<br>Median: 38025.0<br>Standard Deviation: 81206.03894539685<br>Variance: 6594420761.20131<br>Kurtosis: 14.60309669876606</code></p>",

Add the kurtosis action block after the select action block and before the output blocks. In the next problem, you will calculate the same central tendencies for the 2nd Dose Allocations column.</p>",
