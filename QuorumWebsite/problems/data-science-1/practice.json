    "description" : "<p>In this final problem, you will work to build up the program so that it calculates central tendencies for the 2nd Dose Allocation column located in the <a href=https://quorumlanguage.com/data/covid19.csv>covid19.csv</a> file(originally from the <a href=https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Weekly-Pfizer-Allocations/sxbq-3sid>CDC website</a>).</p><p>For this problem, focus on calculating all the same central tendencies for the 2nd Dose Allocations column. First, add the block that removes the selected column. Then add the selection block for the new column. Next, add each of the calculations. The output statements will then display the new values for each of the calculations. Once you have completed all the steps, run the program. The following is the output you should expect to get.</p><p><code>Central Tendencies of the following Column: 1st Dose Allocations<br>Mean: 62061.63265306125<br>Median: 38025.0<br>Standard Deviation: 81206.03894539685<br>Variance: 6594420761.20131<br>Kurtosis: 14.60309669876606<br>Central Tendencies of the following Column: 2nd Dose Allocations<br>Mean: 61923.45238095237<br>Median: 38025.0<br>Standard Deviation: 81217.91840322685<br>Variance: 6596350269.753216<br>Kurtosis: 14.611164710632755</code></p>",

    "hint" : "<p>In this program, you will start from where you left off. This time you will add and edit the blocks so that the same central tendencies are calculated on the column at index three. At the bottom of the program add the remove column block and then add the selection block for the 2nd Dose Allocation column. Then Add the calculation blocks from the tray. Then add the output block that displays the new column header. Finally, add the generic output blocks and build up the output so it outputs each calculation new value. Be sure to follow the given format!</p>",
