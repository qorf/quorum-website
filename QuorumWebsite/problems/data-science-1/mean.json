    "description" : "<p>Over then next six problems you will work to build up a program that calculates central tendencies for two columns of data located in the <a href=https://quorumlanguage.com/data/covid19.csv>covid19.csv</a> file(originally from the <a href=https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Weekly-Pfizer-Allocations/sxbq-3sid>CDC website</a>).</p><p>For this problem, focus on calculating the mean for the 1st Dose Allocations column. First, read through the existing program and decide which block in the tray needs to be added to calculate the mean. Second, notice column two matches to the 1st Dose Allocations column in the covid19.csv file because column indexes start at zero. This column is selected before the mean calculation is done. Finally, once you have added the mean action block, run the program. The following is the output you should expect to get.</p><p><code>Central Tendencies of the following Column: 1st Dose Allocations<br>Mean: 62061.63265306125<br>Median: 0.0<br>Standard Deviation: 0.0<br>Variance: 0.0<br>Kurtosis: 0.0</code></p>",

    "hint" : "<p>Only calculate the mean for column two. Add the mean action block after the select action and before the output blocks. In the next problems, you will calculate the other measures of central tendencies.</p>",
