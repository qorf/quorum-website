Then drop the true or false output block below the logic problem to show your solution to that problem. Once you have solved all four logic problems, run your program and check your answer.</p>",

Your job is to determine if each of those expressions is true or false. If you have answered all four in the code, run your code and check to see if you got it correct. If you are unsure of the answers, after a couple of attempts, you may output each variable to see the results.</p>",
