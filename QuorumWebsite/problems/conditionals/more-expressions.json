    "description" : "<p>In this problem, use an if-else block to decide if 1988 is a leap year. To build the boolean expression for this, the year must be divisible by four and the year must not be divisible by one hundred or is divisible by four hundred. Use this information to add to the basic expression already in the program.</p><p> Use mod to determine if the year is divisible by an number. For example, the first expression to determine if year is divisible by four would be <code>year mod 4 = 0</code>. Aslo, for the second part of the expression, use <code>not=</code> to determine if the year is not divisible by 100.</p>",

    "hint" : "<p>Drop the output blocks into the correct scope and create a boolean expression that calculates whether a year is a leap year. The first requirement is that the year is divisible by four. If the year mod four is zero then this first condition is met. The Second requirement is that the year is not divisible by 100 or the year is divisible by 400. Taking the same approach if the year mod 100 not equal to zero or year mod 400 equals zero, the second condition is met.</p>",
