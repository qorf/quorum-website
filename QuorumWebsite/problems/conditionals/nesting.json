Then, test your program by changing the variable value to a negative number, positive number, and zero. You should expect the output to be the following when the value is -2.</p><p><code>-2 is a negative number.</code></p>",

Change the boolean expression to find if the number is negative and add the output blocks for each of the remaining outcomes. Then run the program with the value variable having a value of -2, 0, and 2 to test your program.</p>",
