Comparisons include less than, greater than, less than equal, greater than equal, and not equal(i.e. <, >, <=, >=, and not=). Logic uses and, or, and not. These compare two values or flop the value and return true or false.</p><p>Don't forget to apply the order of operation rules and logic rules to the problems. If you are not able to find the correct answers, use the output block to output the values of the variables to get the right response.</p>",
