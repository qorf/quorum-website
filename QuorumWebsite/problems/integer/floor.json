    "hint" : "<p>Using the idea of taking the floor of a number, the decimal portion of a number is lost when we use integer types to store the result of a division problem. For example, 33 / 4 equals 8.25, but stored as an integer, it becomes 8. Once you have figured out the right value move the correct output block below the matching question.</p>",
