While you haven't needed them yet, you will when you begin working with loops that repeat actions.</p><p>In this program, edit the counter block on both sides of the equal so that the integer variable, result, is one more than its original value. When you run your program it should output the following text.</p><p><code>Result: 43</code></p>",

    "hint" : "<p>Remember, a counter adds to the current value in the variable. In other words, the counter should use the existing variable instead of counter, <code>result = result + 1</code>. Add the block from the tray into the program and change the name from counter to result.</p>",
