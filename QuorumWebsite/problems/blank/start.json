In this problem, you will drop each block from the tray into the program and run it. Then determine if the blank and comment blocks do anything when the program is run.</p>",

    "hint" : "<p>No, a program does not do anything with a blank or comment block, it just ignores the blocks unless you type working code into the blank block. Professional programmers often use blank blocks because they already know the code they need and don't want to take the time to find the block in the tray. Another use of a blank block is to create a comment. Programmers use comments so that other programmers working with their code can understand what the code does. To make a comment, start with the symbols <strong>//</strong> followed by your comment describing what the code does. </p>",
