This will require that you edit each of the blocks in the tray.</p><p>Use one loop to produce the following output.</p><p><code>5<br>10<br>15<br>20<br>25<br>30</code></p>",

Then, add the blocks inside the loop to output the value of the integer and increase that number. Finally, add the boolean expression for the loop.</p><p>Remember, there are many ways to solve this problem. Use one loop to solve this instead of repeating code manually.</p>",
