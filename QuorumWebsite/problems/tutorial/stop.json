Some types of programs, like graphics or game programs, continue to run indefinitely and must be stopped using the stop button. This program must be stopped using the stop button. </p><p>Using either the mouse or keyboard go to the toolbar and press the run button, explore the chart, and go back to the toolbar and select stop to end the program. Using the keyboard, TAB over to the run button and press ENTER. Explore the chart by pressing TAB to the chart (e.g. your screen reader will identify it as a game button) and press ENTER. Once you have explored the chart, select CTRL + SHIFT + S to stop the program. Alternatively, use ESC and then TAB to navigate back to the toolbar.</p>",
