You will be using these variables to store a first and last name in the next problem.</p><p>Sometimes a program needs to store a value so it can be used or changed later in a program. To do this you first declare a variable. In Quorum, the format of this block is always <code>variableType variableName = value</code>. Using this general format you select the block with the variableType that matches the value you plan to store. Basic types in Quorum, also called primitive types, include text, boolean, integer, and number. Right now you are learning about text. So, the text variable block is used.</p>",
