Then drop the true or false output block below the logic problem to show your solution to that problem. Once you have solved all four logic problems, run your program and check your answer.</p>",

    "hint" : "<p>Four boolean logic expressions are written into the program: true = true and false not= true, true not= false and true = false, false not= true or true = false, false = true or false not= false. For a problem like true = true and false not= true, true = true is evaluated first. Then false not= true is evaluated. Finally, the and operation is evaluated. If you have answered all four in the code, run your code and check to see if you got it correct. If you are unsure of the answers, after a couple of attempts, you may output each variable to see the results.</p>",
