To program a chart you need a use block, a DataFrame with loaded data, a chart object, and the Display action block.</p><p>In this problem create a pie chart that displays the species frequency from the <a href=https://quorumlanguage.com/data/Penguins.csv>penguins.csv</a> data set. First, add the use blocks for a pie chart and data frame. Then, create the data frame object and load the dataset. Finally, run the program to generate and display an accessible pie chart. Also, be sure to stop this type of program when you are done with the chart.</p>",

This makes sure the program knows where to look for any library you might use later in your program. Then add the DataFram object block followed by the load block. Remember, a chart needs data loaded into a data frame to create a chart.</p>",
