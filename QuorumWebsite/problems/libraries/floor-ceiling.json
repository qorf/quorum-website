Edit the floor and ceiling actions so they find the floor and ceiling of 41.4 and output the following messages.</p><p><code>The floor of 41.4 is 41.0<br>The ceiling of 41.4 is 42.0</code></p>",

    "hint" : "<p>Start by adding the use block for the Math library. Next, add the math object block. Then place the correct action block that calculates the floor. Once the block is placed replace the word value with 41.4 so the action can calculate the floor. Then add the output block, which outputs text and the result of the action you placed into the program. Now add the ceiling action block and edit the value to be 41.4. Finally, add the output block for the ceiling result and run your program.</p>",
