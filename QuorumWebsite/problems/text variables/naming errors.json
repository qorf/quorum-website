Variables names cannot end with _ (an underscore) and cannot have spaces. Also, each variable should have a different and meaningful name. For example, if you are storing a first name from a form the variable should be named something like <code>firstName</code> or <code>first_name</code>. Also, know that the names in Quorum are case sensitive. This means <code>firstname</code> is not the same as <code>FirstName</code>.</p>",
