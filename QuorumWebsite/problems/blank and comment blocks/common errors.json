When they type output commands or any other commands, they can make mistakes with the case of the names because they are case-sensitive. You can avoid these types of errors by using the block instead of typing it out. As you become a better programmer you will need to be able to type your code and identify these common errors.</p><p>You can fix this error by deleting the uppercase O and replacing it with a lowercase o. The right command would be <strong>output &quot;Hello World!&quot;</strong>.</p>",
