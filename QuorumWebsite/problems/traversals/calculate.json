A z-score is calculated by taking the value in the column minus the column mean, all divided by the column standard deviation.</p><p>Begin by reading through the existing code and then getting the mean and standard deviation from the column. Then calculate the z-score and use an if block to decide if the value is an outlier. You should expect the program to output the following when it is functioning.</p><p><code>200.0 is an outlier.</code></p>",
