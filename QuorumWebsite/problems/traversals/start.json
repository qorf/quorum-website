    "hint" : "<p>First, drag over the count definition block and then the while loop. Then inside the loop, use the block that gets the value from the column at each location. The counter can be used to access each element in the column, starting at 0 and ending at size minus one. Finally, add the output block and increase the value of count inside the loop. When this program is run, you can expect it to output the values 1 through 30.</p>",
