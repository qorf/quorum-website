        to raise awareness of the assumptions that we (all people) make when 
        reviewing data and try to call them out. Some of these assumptions 
        lie hidden beneath the surface and we want to shed some light on them 
        by going over some examples from the news. This is a useful mode of 
        reflection that will serve the students well when doing reflective writing on the performance tasks.
        Analyzing and interpreting data will typically require some assumptions 
        to be made about the accuracy of the data and the cause of the 
        relationships observed within it. When decisions are made based on a 
        collection of data, they will often rest just as much on that set of 
        assumptions about the data as the data itself. Identifying and validating 
        (or disproving) assumptions is therefore an important part of data 
        analysis. Furthermore, clear communication about how data was 
        interpreted should also include an account of the assumptions made along the way.")
