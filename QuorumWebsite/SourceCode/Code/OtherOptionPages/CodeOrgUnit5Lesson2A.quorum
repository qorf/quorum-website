We will create this project/program step any step as we learn many aspect of OOP. We will use graphics as well as audio in this project. As you are asked to complete and construct this project/program section by section, you will have chance to run the program as you expand the functionality of the program. This practice tis very common when you are creating a lengthy program. This practice naturally gives you a chance to experience the debugging process - for syntax error as well as for logical error - without using the IDE's debugging mode. This lesson covers so many basic concepts and knowledge in one lengthy lesson. You may want to divide the lesson in two or three sessions. If you have a peer who is learning this lesson together, it would be beneficial for both of you to divide this lesson in two parts - Audio handling and Graphics handling. Then one of you can do the audio part and the other can do the Graphics part. In the final stage of completing one multimedia project, you two can combine the code as well as sharing the knowledge learned in the process to each other. This lesson is also organized in the way that you need to test your program in each phase of the development. You will need to complete four activities through the course of this lesson. Be sure to run your code at the end of each activity or even more frequently as you think is necessary. You goal is for each testing is have no syntax errors and no logical errors(eg. the program should run as expected)")

We control the rate of the spin by the mathematical formula we placed as a parameter inside of the parenthesis. The formula is '360 * second * rotateC'. The star or asterisk in Quorum programming language represents the multiplication sign in mathematics. What this formula does is that the image will spin 360 degree every one second if the value in 'rotateC' is 1. But wait… We set the 'value' for the 'variable rotateC' to '0' initially.

This change in turn produces a positive number through the mathematic formula for the parameter for the 'keyC:Rotate()' - that is written in 'action Update(number second)'. The whole process works like a well planned chain-reaction. At the end, your code will start drawing slightly rotated picture for the image (for keyC) moment after moment. The user of your program will start seeing the keyC rotating with the speed of 360 degree per second. With the same logical and mathematical process, the image 'keyC' will stop moving when the user release the key 'A' on the keyboard.
