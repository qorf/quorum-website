This feature is largely experimental, but shows proof of concept and allows for many basic functions to work on the device. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to put programs on an iPhone. The procedures are similar for other iOS devices. Note that this only works on Apple hardware at this time, as is typical for iOS programming. Note that to put Quorum programs onto a real device you will need to follow the steps on making signing certificates but the certificates are not necessary if you will only be running the program through an iOS simulator.")
