The broad reasoning behind these changes was that the team has been doing extensive testing. This includes a wide variety of technical issues, but also tests with pesky humans. After listening to feedback, running studies, and just generally using the system extensively ourselves, we have made a wide variety of targeted adjustments.")
bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Many of the changes could be described as a twisting of the knobs. The overall goal was to not really add that many features, necessarily, but to just sum up and include as much of the wonderful feedback we have received in the last year. These include trying to make the blocks slightly easier to read, easier to know what they mean, and easier to manipulate. We have added syntax highlighting within the blocks, which we think makes it easier to read text values. We have also substantially adjusted the palette. The goal in those changes was to make it more useful and also to make it look nicer. ")

Past this, the block palette itself has received many revisions, online and offline. We summarize these changes below:")
        Array<text> list1
        list1:Add("The left hand side of the block palette, instead of plain circles, now includes a set of fonts and graphics that try to better represent what that collection of blocks do. These options are in a vertical list with horizontal labels
")

")

")
list1:Add("Removed the blue background from the banner at top of the palette
")
list1:Add("Fixed a variety of issues to make the layout of the palette look visually correct at all magnification levels
")
list1:Add("Removed the word 'Class' from the class name at top in the banner section. Decisions like this probably sound silly, but the idea is that we are tightening up the layout and removing anything that isn't semantically a big priority when you are reading. Our goal is to make it more obvious to users what is important information and what is not
")
list1:Add("Removed the word 'Block' for things like Blank Block. Again, the words were not really helping anyone and this frees up visual space
")
list1:Add("Moved the filter to the top of the layout so it is first in the tab order and visually. This way you can jump to the palette, filter it, and more quickly get into what you are trying to find. We hope this is an improvement especially for keyboard users
")
list1:Add("Removed the word Filter from the filter. Visually, we think it looks just a bit off this way, but it frees up space and hopefully it isn't too jarring. Accessibility systems still have the same labels
")
list1:Add("Remove the word 'Class' from whatever class you are using as well. This frees up visual space and was redundant
")
list1:Add("Removed the variable table. This change came largely from observing people use the blocks and noticing they generally did not use this feature. Because it took up a considerable amount of visual space, we removed it. It is possible that some variation of this feature will come back in the future, but we think we need more evidence on how to make it useful if we do
")

")

")
list1:Add("Added a small label to the action blocks in the palette to show what the various types are and lined them up. 
")

Others try to make it more visually obvious what something is. As before, all visual adjustments are fully automated, meaning there remains no difference, other than the visual layer, whether you use blocks or text. The choice remains a personal preference.
")
Array<text> list2
        list2:Add("Added a way to expose the semantic meaning of pieces of the blocks inside the visual editor. For example, a block might have a name, a type, a value, or some other piece. Ironically, these have been exposed to screen reader users for a while, but we hadn't considered exposing them to everyone until someone asked
")
list2:Add("Added syntax highlighting in blocks
")
list2:Add("Adjusted the unique selection colors for blocks to make it more obvious what was selected
")
list2:Add("Adjusted the borders for when a block is selected. The idea is that the focus colors have been improved, but there are also now borders. This is yet one more way we are trying to make the focus more obvious
")
list2:Add("Fixed a bug related to layout when the blocks are showing additional information. This was exposed because of the new semantic information presented, but was a bug in general
")
list2:Add("Added the ability to comment out the selected blocks in the editor. The commands are the same in the text editor and the block editor. One thing to note here is that while commenting in and out is theoretically the same idea as in text, it means something different in blocks and there really are some funny edge cases around scope and other issues. We did not try to manage all the crazy edge cases that can come up because we presumed that having this feature at all was a net improvement. Ideas are welcome, but in general we think this is a quality of life improvement for the blocks system
")
list2:Add("Finished an optimization related to line height in the editor that was causing slowdown in large files. We have significantly reduced the time requirement, improving cpu efficiency in this case by 99.286%. The difference is very large and you can feel it when using the new editor. It just feels ... snappier
")
list2:Add("We made keywords in the dark mode block editor about 15% brighter. Technically, the keywords were already WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, but this was a user request and we went for it. The trick is if you go too bright, you lose a sense of color, so we tried to find a balance. The new contrast ratio for these keywords is 9.56 to 1. We think this is interesting even just because it highlights what often isn't taken into account in contrast calculations, which is that some words are more important than others. 
")
list2:Add("Fixed an unusual bug where if you had an action and went into a blank block mode, it would sometimes trigger an incorrect layout
")
list2:Add("Fixed a very odd little bug where if you created if statements in just the right order and in just the right way, there was a way to make a field disappear from the focus traversal.

If this is you, we just cannot thank you enough! Science doesn't make progress without users sharing their thoughts. Online changes included:

Array<text> list3
        list3:Add("Fixed a bug in the online editor where if you press enter, then start typing in the new block, after a split second, the first character gets shoved later. This always happened in Firefox and Chrome and was infuriating.  This really annoying bug was squashed.
")
list3:Add("Added multiple file support for blocks in a browser, including accessibility support. When you make a block editor, it has to explicitly say the number of files in advance, but in theory should allow us to put as many files as we want wherever we want on the site. You're welcome, Janusz Chmiel.
")
list3:Add("Added support to the Quorum compiler on the live site
")
list3:Add("Fixed a bug where comments and blank blocks were not working correctly in the online IDE when loaded
")
list3:Add("Fixed a bug where with typing inside of the online editor, there does not appear to be a way to add an action. Oddly enough, the code looked and felt wrong, but was correct in the context of what the compiler returned
")
list3:Add("Added significantly improved accessibility support for tablets. This was unbelievably difficult. Uggh. For those that want to code with blocks online and use a tablet in the classroom or otherwise, please feel free to provide feedback. In the current version, we think it works better in browsers with Android than it does iOS, which seems to react differently to the same code
")
list3:Add("Added carefully controlled changes to the buttons as you run or stop programs
")
list3:Add("Finalized a collection of buttons for the Quorum Blocks toolbar, including hide palette, zoom in, zoom out, hotkeys, full screen, run, and stop. These have been slightly altered
")

")
list3:Add("Massively, and we mean ridiculously, absurdly, massively, improved performance of the block editor and the programs it runs online
")
list3:Add("Changed the name of the block palette to the Tray online. It should probably be adjusted in Quorum Studio as well, but we are leaving it for now as there are bigger fish to fry

")
list3:Add("Fixed a bug where under some conditions, it was possible for the layout of blocks to get messed up when selecting a field.
")
list3:Add("Added a feature where you can swipe to the left on a block, or drag a block over the palette, to delete it on tablets. You could technically do this by picking the block up before, but in testing people seemed to think this was more intuitive

It has stayed relatively constant for years, but this year got a significant upgrade to ECMAScript 6. features. The broad purpose of this change was efficiency in the transpile, which has resulted in a significant improvement to memory performance. We made a collection of these changes especially to improve the use of blocks online. The reason we did this is because our online Parsons problems for data science turned out to be much more popular than we expected and we had to adapt quickly.

By late November, we had hit ballpark 500 megs for the combo. As of Quorum 13.0, similar projects take about 94.6 megabytes in size.

There are multiple purposes in doing this, but the big one is to continue our long-standing investigation into Accessible Starvation and Accessible Graphics. As a secondary point, we are hoping to future-proof Mac support. As a third purpose, we are investigating how far the rabbit hole goes for accessible graphics. Put another way, we want to get the system able to generate very fancy graphics with full accessibility support. This is not some idle goal. If this is achievable, it opens up a great number of additional technologies.
")
bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Overall, this project has involved looking at multiple systems for managing the GPU, but especially Vulkan. This project is not trivial and we expect pieces of it will be solved over a 2-year period, with this one being the first. This release does not actually integrate any of this work and we will detail it more next year, but our hope is to have the basics of this upgrade completed by Quorum 14. We may not make the target, but this would put release for the second half of this in 2026.

")
list5:Add("Fixed a strange little bug in the blocks system causing Quorum to layout the blocks on every frame of animation, which was wrong. On the machine we tested it on, this tiny change alone reduced CPU usage by about 25% in our tests. Quorum Studio is still a bit heavy CPU load wise, but small changes like this over time will help
")

")
list5:Add("Fixed an issue in the debugger where if you set a breakpoint, it would take an incredibly long time to put it in the system. This seemed to happen on even a small file, which made us think it was a bug. Our best estimate for its asymptotic complexity was O (gazillion!^9 * log(gadzooks)). Not really, but it felt that way
")
list5:Add("Fixed a bug where the sorting algorithm used to sort the variables was messed up for arrays. The reason is because it was considering them string names as opposed to index values
")
list5:Add("Fixed an accessibility bug with checkboxes. We thought this bug was more general and was causing checkboxes to return the wrong value to accessibility systems. It turned out, however, that it was related to a strange edge case where the accessibility system   received a checkbox before certain setup calls were created under the hood. The issue was windows only, but unrelated to the native implementation. This fixes bug <a href='https://github.com/qorf/quorum-language/issues/116'>https://github.com/qorf/quorum-language/issues/116</a>. Special thanks to Macintoshuser_2 on discord for finding this one.

This version also puts in the groundwork for the web version of accessible blocks, which we are expecting to come online this summer. The biggest features are that we have completed all of the major affordances for the mouse, added a block palette similar to other blocks technologies, and spent a considerable amount of time fine tuning the blocks so they look, feel, and sound like we want them to, for good or ill. Finally, we include in this version an innovation we are calling scaffolded block programming, which users will observe in a special block palette we call Advice. ")

bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Over the last year of blocks being available, the Quorum community has sent us a considerable number of helpful ideas, and yes some bugs, on how they imagine blocks could be for everyone, including those with disabilities. We have done testing, gathered feedback from adults and young people, and answered more emails than we want to think about. We have consolidated all of this feedback and spent a great deal of time thinking, coding, and frankly just tinkering with blocks to make them what we want them to be. Version 2 of Quorum blocks was written in version 1, so you could realistically say we have now been using blocks to build blocks for more than a year. We hope to iterate for years to come and are getting closer and closer every day to our vision for them. ")

bodyDiv:AddParagraph("As one additional feature for blocks, we have created a new way to interact with blocks that we have not seen in other block languages. This system, which we call Scaffolded Block Programming, can predict based on the cursor certain aspects of what code the user may be wanting to write. Additionally, it can pull up documentation as the user works to provide hints related to the context in which they are working. From the user's perspective, we call this the Advice palette. Another way to think about this is that as you use the environment, it tries to give you information, or advice, on the types of things you can do from there.")
bodyDiv:AddParagraph("This system is new and designed to potentially reduce transitional friction between text and block languages. Part of our design philosophy was making it so you do not need to switch for professional practice, while keeping it simple for children. However, since the system is new, we suspect it could use with a solid round of constructive criticism and feedback from a diverse set of people. While we have made decisions for it around the best available evidence we have so far, we suspect it will get adjustments with more evidence and testing. Here is a rough overview of the kinds of things this system does:")

list2:Add("If the horizontal cursor is on a primitive, or some other internal Quorum construct (e.g., output, say), it will now provide information on what the command does in the programming language. The broad idea is that it makes it so the user no longer has to lookup commands they do not remember.")

We did that because it allowed us to put the compiler error messages at the 8th grade reading level.

This feature has been a long-time coming and we were finally able to complete the first version of it.

AccessKit allowed us to plugin to accessibility, similar to how we do on Windows, much more quickly and easily than we were expecting.")

Notably, while nearly all of the systems are working how we intend in this design, the version of AccessKit we are using to make this happen is a pre-release and there are a few remaining issues related to roles, especially in trees, tabs, and tables. For example, tabs think they are radio buttons. This is adorable, but clearly a bug. We plan fixes for these issues as we continue working, but decided the community would benefit if we got out a patch now. Known bugs notwithstanding, this new version is dramatically more accessible and block mode is, in our view, really fun to use in the Voice Over screen reader. We would encourage any Mac Voice Over users to provide any feedback they have about the new version.")

We wanted to improve these systems to make them look more inline with other modern applications. Second, historically, the user interface libraries have been quite difficult to program. We improve that in this version with the introduction of the Form library. Forms are a new way to make small little applications or dialogs and we suspect they will be especially useful on mobile devices. We also suspect they will be useful in dialogs and, while not really the intent, possibly larger desktop applications. Generally, while we did not run a study for this particular feature, we hypothesize they are much easier to use than the old system of creating user interfaces.")

We have also improved the layout of many controls across the board to try and make them look nicer. These systems might make mobile programming easier, as there are now swappable pages that you can use in your applications on a number of platforms. Overall, the improvements are not yet perfect, but they are quite dramatic.

This release was made because in Quorum 10.5, there was a change to the way shaders and batching worked in the graphics engine, which was causing several interface components to render a bit funny. We like funny as much as the next folk, but this was not intended. While working on those systems, we noticed a number of performance and memory issues that we have now fixed. In internal testing, the performance improvements compared to Quorum 4.0.3 are quite substantial. Notes follow:")

Assuming we did not make a mistake, users will not observe any difference in how they use the language, however the memory footprint of Quorum has been significantly reduced because of this change. In Quorum Studio, for example, we are clocking a reduction of about 150 million unneeded objects no longer being created. The objects were small in size, but there were a lot of them, which means that in our internal tests, the memory footprint dropped by about 5%. Other tests, like charts, were more dramatic, with nearly a 35% reduction achievable only by recompiling the same program.")

This shrinks the overall rather large uncompressed standard library file by about 1.5%, due to cutting out a series of operations that were no longer needed in this version.

While this is nice in general, it also improves screen reader accessibility speed significantly.")

We have added a double bootstrapping function to Quorum to auto-build Quorum Studio using both an overridden standard library and a source compiler.

Historically, because Quorum Studio was used across many school systems, we kept the OpenGL version rather old, as some schools use older hardware. Notably, we were using OpenGL 2.1, from 2006. While this system worked well enough to invent much of the accessible graphics pipeline in the language, OpenGL 2.1 used a particular kind of graphics pipeline that is now outdated. Further, OpenGL is having challenges today. Apple has deprecated this system, limits it to OpenGL 4.1 (about 2011 or so), and is quite slow compared to Windows in our testing. Further, OpenGL itself is sometimes being replaced by third parties (e.g., Apple's metal, Vulkan), while others still are maintaining it (e.g., WebGL, Android). The future of OpenGL is thus uncertain and we are preparing for the potential reality where its creators abandon it.")

How to make 2D games accessible is a major challenge and we suspect we could iterate on this design for decades. In the first version, we have focused on a scene and Palette tabs, which live in the project tree, and that allow you to either drag and drop or, with the keyboard, create maps, place characters, and set properties in a scene. Physics and many other things are controllable from a game and Quorum 8 natively understands these scenes in the game engine. These scenes can then be loaded in a native Quorum game. We find it to be much easier to create games in this new version.")

There are now keyboard navigable annotations that show up in the editor, which indicate information like hints or Git file differences. In addition, we've improved performance and squashed a bunch of bugs in the editor. We have also included some accessibility hotkeys to give screen reader users more information about where they are in the editor. These keys are hooked up to a few other components as well and provide summaries or location info. This is especially useful, we think, in the accessible scene editor.")

This also includes a 'live on the edge' track. If you are in the beta program, you can always grab the latest build from the Quorum team. This lets you grab exactly the same version our dev team uses when building Quorum Studio and Quorum. To get it, you can set the beta flag in your quorum studio preferences file. So far, this is intentionally not exposed in the user interface so users don't do it accidentally.")

For instances of Quorum Studio with multiple large projects open, like reading multiple versions of Quorum's entire standard library, we are getting in the range of 4.5 gigabytes after a day of continual use. CPU usage at idle is now down on our end to values we see that are comparable to Firefox, Slack, or other utilities. Compared to our older Sodbeans, we have calculated that for small projects we have ballpark a 50% reduction in memory usage overall. These numbers vary by operating system and usage, but the point is that we have made big strides this year and this should help the user experience, especially for those of us without access to high-powered machines.

We have continued making the standard library faster, more robust, and more flexible. In addition, we have included integration with scenes right in. Besides this, we have made a considerable number of small changes to the libraries, adding extra actions here and there where we think it makes coding in Quorum just a little bit easier. For optimization, we have integrated a great deal of the improvements on memory and processor consumption into the standard library itself so that all users in the open source community can benefit.")

Notably, we could not realistically have built Quorum without it. We also want to thank the members of the NetBeans community, especially colleagues at Sun/Oracle, the old NetBeans Dream Team, or others like Geertjan Wielenga or Tim Boudreau that helped support us so much over the years. While we are super excited about our new direction and having our own toolchain to directly control accessibility has been a dream for years, we would not be here without that community's help and support and so we wanted to say thank you one last time!")

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("In NetBeans, we had to require behind the scenes and somewhat custom installation of Java and other dependencies, which became complicated as Oracle tightened their license agreements. Eventually, this forced us to recommend users switch to OpenJDK, which made installation even more complicated. Over time, this felt to the development team like this process was getting harder and harder for teachers and students. In Quorum Studio, we bundle the minimal subset of additional dependencies in with the installer on Mac and Windows automatically. Generally, if the installer is used, everything required by Quorum Studio should be included without altering system settings and without any complex additional steps.")

We have remapped many of the default hotkeys away from the defaults in NetBeans to make them more intuitive. Normally, we are now using the first letter of an operation as a mnemonic. For example, running a program would be COMMAND + R on Mac or CTRL + R on Windows. Many other hotkeys have been default remapped similarly.")

Quorum Studio is built on the hardware accelerated graphics platform in Quorum itself, which automatically connects down for accessibility (e.g., to screen readers). Besides screen reader connections, we have smart zooming features, keyboard shortcuts for a great deal of operations, and have worked hard to make navigating around the environment accessible and intuitive. In our first release, we only support screen readers on the Windows 10 platform. If we are lucky, we'll be able to raise enough capital to add other platforms over time. ")

By far, the biggest changes are significant additions to the user interface libraries, which form the foundation of Quorum Studio. This includes, especially, a near complete rewrite of the accessibility backend. Some of the major changes include altering how the graphics system connects to the accessibility systems and adding a variety of helper actions for providing context to the accessibility system. For example, it is possible to now directly ask a user interface component to send an accessibility event, even if the on-screen graphics is doing something different. This, and many other features, is incredibly useful for a wide variety of potential applications. ")

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Quorum Studio is written in Quorum 7.5 from the ground up. The development environment we are using to build Quorum studio is also, you guessed it, Quorum Studio. This means that at this point we are eating our own dog food for the full pipeline, including for evolving the pipeline. To put this in perspective, Quorum's compiler is written in Quorum, our standard library is in Quorum, and now our development environment is too. As we have slowly built up and built out our environments, this has made it easier for us long-term to make progress on the project as a whole and to cut our reliance on third party tools, which cannot always be relied on for accessibility.")

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("While we are excited about the release of Quorum Studio, with it comes just a tiny bit of sadness with the official deprecation of Sodbeans. While Sodbeans was always just a NetBeans derivative, with some accessibility enhancements and Quorum support, it was never as accessible as we wanted. It helped us start a community, but over time NetBeans was showing its age and was actively standing in the way of the innovations we wanted to make. As such, with the release of Quorum Studio, our development team has made the switch internally and we now use it exclusively for Quorum development. Further, NetBeans is no longer supported for the Quorum programming language and we do not plan to maintain it further. Schools and community partners can continue using it as they see fit, of course, but we suspect many partners will also make the change as Quorum Studio gets off the ground and matures over time.")

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("As a final note, we want to provide a thank you to the community. Building this technology was a long, multi-year process. It took way longer to invent than we imagined and there were considerable technical and human challenges along the way. A ton of community members participated in our beta programs, many of you before Quorum Studio was really ready for prime time. Especially, we would like to thank Sina Bahram (Prime Access Consulting), Matt Campbell (Microsoft), Ameer Armaly (Google), and all of the amazing teachers at the 2019 Experience Programming in Quorum workshop. Crucially, we also want to thank the National Science Foundation, which made it possible to fund this crazy adventure in the first place.

        library, significantly improved accessibility support, android support, basic 
        network services support, and other features. Because many of the feature 
        requests for our usual yearly cycle were so large, some we implemented about

        building our own interface libraries, we can directly control the accessibility 
        pipeline, providing us far more freedom in research than was ever possible 
        using NetBeans and Swing. Second, we also want to provide a way for the 'output' 
        of the code people write to be natively accessible, even for highly graphical 
        2D or 3D content. Finally, NetBeans itself was moved to the Apache Foundation 
        from Oracle. From a licensing and governance perspective, that's reasonable, 
        but whether the environment will be financially supported, and for how long, 
        is uncertain. As such, while NetBeans will not be supported in Quorum 7 and

As is a long tradition in programming language design, once a language is sufficiently powerful to write the next version in itself, so-called self-hosting, it is a sign that the language is becoming increasingly mature. On Quorum, we have finally reached this milestone and will now be shifting our attention to improved library and development environment support. Library requests to the team, or contributions, are welcome.")
