Needless to say, while many of the changes really just make iOS function correctly under the hood, the bigger point is that this architecture is getting more mature in ways that should make it easier to adjust in the future.

We made these changes for many reasons, but first, a big one is that many of the colors and other properties, while accessible, are also subjectively ugly. We wanted to improve these systems to make them look more inline with other modern applications. Second, historically, the user interface libraries have been quite difficult to program. We improve that in this version with the introduction of the Form library. Forms are a new way to make small little applications or dialogs and we suspect they will be especially useful on mobile devices. We also suspect they will be useful in dialogs and, while not really the intent, possibly larger desktop applications. Generally, while we did not run a study for this particular feature, we hypothesize they are much easier to use than the old system of creating user interfaces.")

Many of these changes are subtle and some of the ones for individual controls are listed in their specific section. We have also improved the layout of many controls across the board to try and make them look nicer. These systems might make mobile programming easier, as there are now swappable pages that you can use in your applications on a number of platforms. Overall, the improvements are not yet perfect, but they are quite dramatic. Documentation for how to use this system will be left to future work, as we needed to build it first to figure out how it should work ourselves.")

In Quorum Studio, for example, we are clocking a reduction of about 150 million unneeded objects no longer being created. The objects were small in size, but there were a lot of them, which means that in our internal tests, the memory footprint dropped by about 5%.

Historically, because Quorum Studio was used across many school systems, we kept the OpenGL version rather old, as some schools use older hardware. Notably, we were using OpenGL 2.1, from 2006. While this system worked well enough to invent much of the accessible graphics pipeline in the language, OpenGL 2.1 used a particular kind of graphics pipeline that is now outdated. Further, OpenGL is having challenges today. Apple has deprecated this system, limits it to OpenGL 4.1 (about 2011 or so), and is quite slow compared to Windows in our testing. Further, OpenGL itself is sometimes being replaced by third parties (e.g., Apple's metal, Vulkan), while others still are maintaining it (e.g., WebGL, Android). The future of OpenGL is thus uncertain and we are preparing for the potential reality where its creators abandon it.")

In discussions, the lower-case e provides a natural separation point compared to the upper case, which we suspect matches her results better than allowing the capital E. Note that scientific notation is allowed only for numbers, but not integers. Future evidence may cause us to alter this design, but given this is a standard that is often taught in schools and used on calculators, we think it is reasonable.")

How to make 2D games accessible is a major challenge and we suspect we could iterate on this design for decades. In the first version, we have focused on a scene and Palette tabs, which live in the project tree, and that allow you to either drag and drop or, with the keyboard, create maps, place characters, and set properties in a scene. Physics and many other things are controllable from a game and Quorum 8 natively understands these scenes in the game engine. These scenes can then be loaded in a native Quorum game. We find it to be much easier to create games in this new version.")

There are now keyboard navigable annotations that show up in the editor, which indicate information like hints or Git file differences. In addition, we've improved performance and squashed a bunch of bugs in the editor. We have also included some accessibility hotkeys to give screen reader users more information about where they are in the editor. These keys are hooked up to a few other components as well and provide summaries or location info. This is especially useful, we think, in the accessible scene editor.")

In 2.0, you'll need to uninstall/reinstall 1.1 because of changes behind the scenes, but after that, Quorum Studio can update itself from the Quorum Servers. This also includes a 'live on the edge' track. If you are in the beta program, you can always grab the latest build from the Quorum team. This lets you grab exactly the same version our dev team uses when building Quorum Studio and Quorum. To get it, you can set the beta flag in your quorum studio preferences file.

For instances of Quorum Studio with multiple large projects open, like reading multiple versions of Quorum's entire standard library, we are getting in the range of 4.5 gigabytes after a day of continual use. CPU usage at idle is now down on our end to values we see that are comparable to Firefox, Slack, or other utilities. Compared to our older Sodbeans, we have calculated that for small projects we have ballpark a 50% reduction in memory usage overall. These numbers vary by operating system and usage, but the point is that we have made big strides this year and this should help the user experience, especially for those of us without access to high-powered machines.

We have continued making the standard library faster, more robust, and more flexible. In addition, we have included integration with scenes right in. Besides this, we have made a considerable number of small changes to the libraries, adding extra actions here and there where we think it makes coding in Quorum just a little bit easier. For optimization, we have integrated a great deal of the improvements on memory and processor consumption into the standard library itself so that all users in the open source community can benefit.")

Notably, we could not realistically have built Quorum without it. We also want to thank the members of the NetBeans community, especially colleagues at Sun/Oracle, the old NetBeans Dream Team, or others like Geertjan Wielenga or Tim Boudreau that helped support us so much over the years. While we are super excited about our new direction and having our own toolchain to directly control accessibility has been a dream for years, we would not be here without that community's help and support and so we wanted to say thank you one last time!")

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("In NetBeans, we had to require behind the scenes and somewhat custom installation of Java and other dependencies, which became complicated as Oracle tightened their license agreements. Eventually, this forced us to recommend users switch to OpenJDK, which made installation even more complicated. Over time, this felt to the development team like this process was getting harder and harder for teachers and students. In Quorum Studio, we bundle the minimal subset of additional dependencies in with the installer on Mac and Windows automatically. Generally, if the installer is used, everything required by Quorum Studio should be included without altering system settings and without any complex additional steps.")

For example, running a program would be COMMAND + R on Mac or CTRL + R on Windows. Many other hotkeys have been default remapped similarly.")

Quorum Studio is built on the hardware accelerated graphics platform in Quorum itself, which automatically connects down for accessibility (e.g., to screen readers). Besides screen reader connections, we have smart zooming features, keyboard shortcuts for a great deal of operations, and have worked hard to make navigating around the environment accessible and intuitive. In our first release, we only support screen readers on the Windows 10 platform. If we are lucky, we'll be able to raise enough capital to add other platforms over time. ")

By far, the biggest changes are significant additions to the user interface libraries, which form the foundation of Quorum Studio. This includes, especially, a near complete rewrite of the accessibility backend. Some of the major changes include altering how the graphics system connects to the accessibility systems and adding a variety of helper actions for providing context to the accessibility system. For example, it is possible to now directly ask a user interface component to send an accessibility event, even if the on-screen graphics is doing something different. This, and many other features, is incredibly useful for a wide variety of potential applications. ")

        bodyDiv:AddHeading("A Quorum environment written in Quorum", 2)
        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Quorum Studio is written in Quorum 7.5 from the ground up. The development environment we are using to build Quorum studio is also, you guessed it, Quorum Studio. This means that at this point we are eating our own dog food for the full pipeline, including for evolving the pipeline. To put this in perspective, Quorum's compiler is written in Quorum, our standard library is in Quorum, and now our development environment is too. As we have slowly built up and built out our environments, this has made it easier for us long-term to make progress on the project as a whole and to cut our reliance on third party tools, which cannot always be relied on for accessibility.")

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("While we are excited about the release of Quorum Studio, with it comes just a tiny bit of sadness with the official deprecation of Sodbeans. While Sodbeans was always just a NetBeans derivative, with some accessibility enhancements and Quorum support, it was never as accessible as we wanted. It helped us start a community, but over time NetBeans was showing its age and was actively standing in the way of the innovations we wanted to make. As such, with the release of Quorum Studio, our development team has made the switch internally and we now use it exclusively for Quorum development. Further, NetBeans is no longer supported for the Quorum programming language and we do not plan to maintain it further. Schools and community partners can continue using it as they see fit, of course, but we suspect many partners will also make the change as Quorum Studio gets off the ground and matures over time.")

        bodyDiv:AddParagraph("As a final note, we want to provide a thank you to the community. Building this technology was a long, multi-year process. It took way longer to invent than we imagined and there were considerable technical and human challenges along the way. A ton of community members participated in our beta programs, many of you before Quorum Studio was really ready for prime time. Especially, we would like to thank Sina Bahram (Prime Access Consulting), Matt Campbell (Microsoft), Ameer Armaly (Google), and all of the amazing teachers at the 2019 Experience Programming in Quorum workshop. Crucially, we also want to thank the National Science Foundation, which made it possible to fund this crazy adventure in the first place.

network services support, and other features. Because many of the feature 
requests for our usual yearly cycle were so large, some we implemented about 
half in the first year. This is especially true for user interface support,

backend, with the rest planned for Quorum 7.")
bodyDiv:AddParagraph("Further, as part of Quorum 6, we are hard at work on a 
new Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the language, which we have 
code named Quorum Studio. The reason we did this is several-fold. First, by 
building our own interface libraries, we can directly control the accessibility 
pipeline, providing us far more freedom in research than was ever possible 
using NetBeans and Swing. Second, we also want to provide a way for the 'output' 
of the code people write to be natively accessible, even for highly graphical 
2D or 3D content. Finally, NetBeans itself was moved to the Apache Foundation 
from Oracle. From a licensing and governance perspective, that's reasonable, 
but whether the environment will be financially supported, and for how long, 
is uncertain. As such, while NetBeans will not be supported in Quorum 7 and 
beyond, we expect all future releases of Quorum to be available in the console,

Besides these larger changes, we have spent considerable time making improvements to a large number of systems in Quorum and have expanded on many.

Overall, the 2D system has been improved and simplified in a variety of ways, the overall libraries have been unified, and accessibility support is now baked in in ways we think are easier to understand.")

As is a long tradition in programming language design, once a language is sufficiently powerful to write the next version in itself, so-called self-hosting, it is a sign that the language is becoming increasingly mature.
