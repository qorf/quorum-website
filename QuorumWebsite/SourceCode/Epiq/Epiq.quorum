coding can be integrated across all individuals; regardless of visual limitations and
accommodations needed to make each individual successful. The EPIQ workshop embodied a
team of extremely knowledgeable individuals in computer coding and assistive technology that
made learning fun, easy to comprehend, and worked with the pace of each individual, as some
were more versed in computer coding and some who have never had access to computer coding,such as myself. The pace of the workshop was not intimidating for new learners as there were different sessions one could partake in, depending on the level and pace of the learner. The weeklong workshop flew by, with each day and team member presenting valuable information that was easy to follow and model. The teachers at EPIQ made the environment comfortable to ask questions or gain more insight into a particular step of learning the Quorum program. Glitches within the Quorum programming software that were mentioned in class were tackled with immediate solutions to allow learning to continue smoothly for the following days. The teachers at EPIQ allowed for openness of new ideas on how to make the program better for all individuals, promoted feedback, and never made individuals feel as if they were traveling down the learning path alone. While attending EPIQ, I was opened to new resources for individuals with visual impairments, as well as learning how to make a reminder app that my students can use in real life. EPIQ was an incredible experience and one I now look forward to every year!

Students with Visual Impairments, and with real-life experience of adults with visual
impairments struggling to secure and maintain employment, I was very interested in learning
how to teach my students how to write code with an accessible program. I love the way the
week was catered towards teaching the novice and the experienced coders. The week not only
gave us experience with coding but also the tools to take back to our students through the
Quorum Studio app, (where we build our code), through the learning modules, the Quorum
website, and the means in which to contact and communicate with the pros when we need
support. Currently, I am taking a 9 th grade student through the modules and am using basic
programming materials from APH for my younger students. I highly recommend this training
for anyone with a passion to give their students skills for post high school job opportunities.
