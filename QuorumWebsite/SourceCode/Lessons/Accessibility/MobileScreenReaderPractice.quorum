        section:AddParagraph("While desktop screen readers like NVDA or JAWS rely on a more traditional computer setup, mobile screen readers are designed for the smaller, touch based devices. Navigation and interaction on mobile screen readers thus need to work with gestures and vibrotactile feedback. Exactly what they should do in this situation is an active topic of academic research.")
        section:AddParagraph("The two major screen readers you will encounter when working with mobile devices are <strong>TalkBack</strong> and <strong>VoiceOver</strong>. TalkBack is built into Android devices while VoiceOver is built into iOS devices. While the name, VoiceOver, is the same as in the previous sections, it is a different tool that even uses different libraries under the hood. Both screen readers rely heavily on touch-based gestures such as swipes, taps, and pinches. This shift in the interaction model requires a different approach when it comes to accessibility. You need to learn how to navigate with touch, but also on a technical level how to manage rather significant technical inconsistencies across these platforms.")

        AddHeading(section, "Turning The Screen Reader On", 3)
        section:AddParagraph("Mobile platforms vary on how to turn screen readers on. Further, due to the nature of Android devices, there may be several ways to turn on the screen reader based on the device. The most common way to start TalkBack on an Android device is to first navigate to the Settings app. From there, go to Accessibility and find the TalkBack option under the Screen readers section. Once you select it, toggle the switch to enable TalkBack. Once enabled, TalkBack will provide spoken feedback for all on-screen elements, and you can begin using touch gestures to navigate your device.")
        section:AddParagraph("To enable VoiceOver on an iOS device, open the Settings app and navigate to Accessibility. There should be an option for VoiceOver, and toggle the switch to turn it on. You’ll be prompted with a confirmation message letting you know that VoiceOver will change the way your device responds to touch gestures. Once activated, VoiceOver will read aloud on-screen text and interface elements, and you can start using the touch gestures specific to VoiceOver for navigation and interaction.")

        AddHeading(section, "Navigation", 3)
        section:AddParagraph("On a desktop screen reader, you can still use your computer as normal with the screen reader running and only adding some functionality in specific cases. On mobile this is not really the case. Specifically, the screen reader takes over how you interact with the device normally. You can still tap on the screen in specific spots, but in order to navigate with a mobile screen reader on you will need to learn how the gestures change.")

        section:AddParagraph("For high level context, the most crucial point to understand is that with the screen reader on, navigation is again all about structure. When you think about it with touch devices, this is rational. If you have vision challenges, moving your finger around on the screen hunting for something is certainly possible, but clunky. Navigating with gestures instead allows the user to quickly hunt through high level items trying to find what they want. Generally, if you remember nothing else about navigation, gestures and double tap can get you pretty far.")

        AddHeading(section, "TalkBack Context Menus", 3)
        section:AddParagraph("Talkback features a series of menus that allow you to quickly change certain settings and controls. There is a global context menu, which has options that can be applied anywhere on the device. It also has a local context menu that has options that are relevant to the content currently on the screen.")
        AddHeading(section, "<i>Global Context Menu</i>", 4)
        section:AddParagraph("To access the global context menu, swipe <i>down</i> then right with one finger in a single motion. This menu offers several important options for screen reader users. You can choose to have the screen read from the top or from the next item, repeat the last thing that was spoken, or activate screen search to find specific content. The menu also includes options for adjusting language or speech settings, accessing TalkBack preferences, and using text editing tools. These features allow users to better control how content is read aloud and make navigation more efficient.")
        AddHeading(section, "<i>Local Context Menu</i>", 4)
        section:AddParagraph("To access the local context menu, swipe <i>up</i> then right with one finger in a single motion. The menu that appears changes based on what is currently open. For example if you are in Chrome there will be navigation options like headings, links, and paragraphs.")
        section:AddParagraph("Also note that because Android is available on a wider range of devices, the local context menu can vary for each device. For example, Samsung devices have their own customized version of TalkBack so the menu may appear different from a Google Pixel. While it might be ideal if this were standardized, or at least more consistent on Android, in practice it can take quite a bit of testing to figure out what makes sense for users at a technical level due to the inconsistencies. In general, although they work differently, these concepts in TalkBack are sort of similar to VoiceOver's Rotor.")

        AddHeading(section, "VoiceOver Rotor", 3)
        section:AddParagraph("The <strong>Rotor</strong> in VoiceOver for iOS is similar, but also different. In this case, the idea is the same: make it easier to navigate complex content. It allows you to jump between different types of content, such as headings, links, form fields, and more, using gestures. The Rotor provides a quick way to interact with specific elements on a web page or within an app without the need to manually swipe through each one, making it particularly useful when working with long or complex documents.")
        section:AddParagraph("To pull up the Rotor in VoiceOver on iOS, you need to use a two-finger twist gesture, similar to rotating a dial. This action allows the Rotor to appear with a selection of options tailored to the content on the screen. Once activated, the Rotor will display different navigation choices, such as Headings, Links, Form Controls, Text, Landmarks, and more, depending on the content being viewed.")

For example, if you are reading a web page and select Headings from the Rotor, they can swipe up or down to quickly navigate between the headings on the page. If you want to jump between links, you can select Links from the Rotor and then swipe to move through the hyperlinks on the page. This can save the time and effort of manually searching for a specific section or link by going through each element in order.")

        AddHeading(section, "Explore by Touch", 3)
        section:AddParagraph("If you use a mobile device, you might already be used to navigating by looking where an item is located on the screen physically and touching that part of the screen. Mobile Screen readers have a feature that closely resembles this called <strong>Explore by Touch</strong>. Explore by Touch allows you to navigate content on the screen by physically moving your finger around the screen. When your finger is above something on the screen the screen reader will read aloud the item and typically it is accompanied by haptic feedback.")
        section:AddParagraph("Explore by Touch is an attempt to help you feel the content on the screen. It mimics the way a sighted person could scan the screen visually by translating that into a tactile or audio experience of moving your finger across the screen. While useful and allows a more intuitive way for you to navigate a mobile screen reader it is still important to understand how to get around with gestures and ignoring and the physical positioning of objects on the screen.")
