Again, the question becomes, is this understandable and to whom? No doubt many humans can learn many things, but WCAG is asking the community to think it through.

Assistive technologies such as screen readers can change voices for different languages or dialects, so setting the language correctly can help users understand the content better.")
        section:AddParagraph("These guidelines also seem to suggest that content is easier to understand if navigation is relatively consistent. Guidelines 3.2.1 and 3.3.2 suggest that navigating a page or inputting something should not alter the context of the page.")
        section:AddParagraph("3.3.1 Error Identification is an example in which the criteria of WCAG might be simple, but when you think about them in practice, there is no guidance on implementation and the criteria might feel open-ended.")
        section:AddParagraph("Let’s look at 3.3.1 Error Identification more closely. Say you have an online form that requests a user to put an address in, but they forgot to input it and press the submit button. Consider the type of error information you could provide to the user. For example, text could appear that says ‘There was a problem.’ You could argue that this text satisfies the criterion, because when the user encounters an error, they are  provided text that informs them of the error. However, one could reasonably argue that while this text may technically meet WCAG requirements, it falls short of the spirit of good accessibility. This highlights the limitations of WCAG, it can guide you, but only to a certain extent.")
        section:AddParagraph("Guideline 3.3.1 also states that the error should be described. Perhaps, in the context of your system, you know there is an error, but you do not know the exact problem. Consider how you could present the error. Think about the location of the error, the color used, any icons associated with the error, the timing of when to show the error, and so on. For example, you could place it at the end of the form during validation, or you could detect and present the error immediately as the user is typing. These are all important questions to ask yourself when it comes to designing for accessibility, and it is important to understand that this can vary across different systems.")
        section:AddParagraph("For computer science, perhaps the most definitive source on errors is the work by Becker et al. [3]. The key to understanding is that error commonality by humans tends to follow exponential decline. Further, in this exponential decline, some errors are dramatically more harmful than others. Finally, even small changes to the error messages can make a big impact. Any designer working with errors should read this source as a starting point for understandability on that topic.")

For the web, this means using semantic HTML elements and specific roles so that assistive technology behaves a certain way when interacting with content.")
        section:AddParagraph("The bottom line is that when content is so-called robust, it means that various technologies for people with disabilities can connect in. Almost always, this involves a combination of scripts and tags, if in a browser. On desktop and mobile, the situation is different. You need an array of technologies to make something robust.")
        section:AddParagraph("Given the complexity, the discussion here should be considered preliminary. Robustness is a very complex aspect of accessibility and is extremely technical. If anything, meeting robustness is part of the reason we call this tutorial <strong>Technical Accessibility</strong>. In essence, technical accessibility means that even our core technologies, like programming languages themselves, are not immune to considerations like understandability. However, it also means that sometimes you just need to get down and dirty with the technology and force it to work with accessibility technologies at a purely nerd level.")

While WCAG states that there should be roles and labels on a component, the standard does not tell you what exactly the correct role is in all situations. As you will see in later sections about the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) standard, sometimes how assistive technologies or browsers interact with such information can be inconsistent.")
        section:AddParagraph("This rule in WCAG is just one in a giant sea of rules, but we highlight it here because it is deeply, crucially, important. The wrong roles cause applications to not be accessible in many cases and for very hard to understand reasons. The core can be hard to understand, so consider an example.")
        section:AddParagraph("Suppose a component, on any platform, has the role of ‘button’. One might presume, incorrectly, that this is just a flag to the system on what it is. Perhaps a screen reader reads it. When something has a role, it is true that it is a flag to the system. What is less clear, however, is that the systems sent this role often have follow up questions. If an accessibility device is told a button has the focus, it might then send back questions, like, ‘Are you enabled or disabled?’ It might also ask for the color, the text on the button, or other attributes. Other components, especially text fields and text boxes, may ask hundreds of questions on the user's behalf (e.g., the font, the cursor, the colors, bolding).")
        section:AddParagraph("This simple example highlights why these roles are so crucial and so devastating to people with disabilities if they are missing. If a role is missing, then an accessibility system does not just not know something exists, but it also cannot ask questions automatically. It breaks the question-asking robot that ultimately leads to robustness. This back and forth between systems is the heart of how accessibility works.")
        section:AddParagraph("This example also highlights why a current trend is accessibility where somehow a Large Language Model will <em>auto-magically</em> fix everything through hand waving AI. AI has a purpose sometimes and may have some benefits for accessibility in some situations. However, resorting to it often completely misses the point. You do not need a large language model to probabilistically guess what might sort of be a correct description when the point is actually the programmatically correct technique of robustness, which requires interactivity in a myriad of automatic and human ways.")
        section:AddParagraph("On desktop platforms, you can sometimes change code to have complete control of the back and forth described previously. On the web, while it is very powerful for accessibility, the amount of control is quite limited. One way that you can claw back just a little bit of control is through the application of ARIA.")

The language descriptions can matter. The tags can matter. When doing accessible design, the balance between thinking big picture about what matters, and thinking outside the box a bit, actually matters a great deal.")
