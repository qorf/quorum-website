This means that behavior varies by browser, which is a common technical frustration with the specification.")
        section:AddParagraph("ARIA alone does not change functionality or visual appearance. A good rule of thumb is that ARIA is intended to <i>enhance</i> HTML, but it does not replace it or change what the code does programmatically. Mentioned in the WCAG 2.2 A, Section 3 and 4 Lesson, the main features of ARIA are roles, properties, and states. As a brief reminder, consider an example of what each of these are:")

        section:AddParagraph("A crucial idea to understand is that while ARIA describes information about the HTML, at the end of the day, the words and symbols used in the specification get mapped down to the computer's operating system. However, Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android all have incompatible ways of managing these attributes, so naturally there are inconsistencies in how ARIA is used and interpreted. Unfortunately, this means developers are stuck with typing out the ARIA and hoping it works how the specification says it should, which is often wrong.")
        section:AddParagraph("The use of ARIA attributes should be based on both their specification and real-world testing. Overuse or misuse of ARIA can degrade accessibility rather than improve it [1], particularly when roles and attributes are not used together as expected.")

        AddHeading(section, "Roles", 3)
        section:AddParagraph("<strong>ARIA roles</strong> are fundamental to making custom and complex web interfaces accessible to users who rely on assistive technologies. At their core, roles assign a specific purpose or identity to elements on a web page. These roles inform screen readers and other assistive tools how to interpret and interact with the element in question. For example, an element with a role=’textbox’ will be treated as an editable text field by a screen reader, even if it is visually styled with nothing more than a "+lt+"div> or "+lt+"span>.")
        section:AddParagraph("It is important to remember that assigning an ARIA role does not automatically make an element interactive or functional. While roles provide semantic meaning, actual behavior must often be implemented with JavaScript. Whenever possible, native HTML elements should be used first, since they come with built-in semantics and accessibility support. For example, "+lt+"button> or "+lt+"input type=’checkbox’> have roles like ‘button’ and ‘checkbox’ baked in and already follow expected accessibility behaviors.")
        section:AddParagraph("However, in some cases, developers build entirely custom components using "+lt+"div> or "+lt+"span> elements, applying roles and behaviors manually. This is where ARIA becomes vital. If you’re replacing a native control or building something new, applying the correct role and managing its behavior and relationships becomes essential.")

        AddHeading(section, "Landmark Roles", 4)
        section:AddParagraph("Among ARIA roles, landmark roles serve to define sections of a web page. These roles allow users to navigate quickly using their assistive technology. For instance, screen reader users can skip directly to the main content or jump to the navigation bar if these areas are marked appropriately. Roles like banner, navigation, main, complementary, and contentinfo help break up the page into recognizable regions.")
        section:AddParagraph("These roles do not change how elements appear visually, but they offer powerful structural hints that improve navigability, especially for those not using a mouse or relying on visual cues. Used correctly, they allow for a more streamlined experience when navigating pages with repetitive elements.")

        AddHeading(section, "Widget Roles", 4)
        section:AddParagraph("One of the subcategories of roles in ARIA are known as the <strong>widget roles</strong>. These describe interactive interface elements. They are essential when developers create custom controls that do not rely on native HTML. For example, if a developer creates a toggle switch from scratch using "+lt+"div> elements, they might assign role=’switch’ to help define how that control behaves from an accessibility standpoint.")
        section:AddParagraph("Widget roles are broad and include types like button, checkbox, dialog, slider, and tab. These roles are typically assigned to elements that accept user input or perform an action. However, it is important to understand that assigning a role like checkbox does not make the element checkable by itself, developers must still implement the interaction logic and update relevant states using JavaScript.")
        section:AddParagraph("When building widgets from scratch, developers need to consider not just roles but also the appropriate ARIA attributes and keyboard support to ensure the experience is accessible and usable across various devices.")

        AddHeading(section, "Simple and Composite Widgets", 4)

Examples include a tablist that contains multiple tab elements and a corresponding set of tabpanel sections. Similarly, a menu widget may contain multiple menuitem roles that allow users to navigate a series of choices. These widgets require careful coordination between the parent and child roles, keyboard navigation patterns, and dynamic ARIA state updates.")

Ensuring that focus management, role relationships, and state updates are correctly applied is essential. Without these, the widget might be visually usable but completely unusable for someone relying on assistive technology.")
        section:AddParagraph("The point is to recognize that ARIA expands upon native HTML elements. However, using ARIA requires that you do some real and thorough testing. Sometimes it can be truly finicky. This lesson gives a brief overview of what is available, but is not the end of the story. Just adding a word to the HTML is often not enough for accessibility.")


        AddHeading(section, "States And Properties", 3)
        section:AddParagraph("ARIA also provides a rich set of attributes called <strong>states and properties</strong>, which describe the current status or behavior of an element beyond its role. These attributes can inform a user whether a checkbox is checked (aria-checked), if a section is collapsed (aria-expanded), or whether a field is required (aria-required).")
        section:AddParagraph("<strong>States</strong> usually represent dynamic conditions, or attributes that may change over time. <strong>Properties</strong> tend to be static descriptions or associations that help define an element’s relationships or meaning, such as aria-label, which provides a textual label for elements without visible text, or aria-describedby, which references another element that offers a longer description.")
        section:AddParagraph("While ARIA attributes are designed to improve accessibility, their real-world effectiveness can vary based on screen reader support and how each attribute is implemented. For instance, aria-describedby, introduced in ARIA 1.0, remains broadly supported and reliably interpreted. In contrast, newer attributes like aria-description, added in ARIA 1.2 to provide additional user-facing context, are still inconsistently supported across different screen readers. The impact of a given ARIA state or property also depends on context. For example some attributes like aria-label, are global and almost always announced, while others, such as aria-valuemin and aria-valuemax, may be ignored on elements like buttons where they do not apply semantically.")
        section:AddParagraph("This might sound straightforward, but it’s a key concept. One of the most common questions is: <i>Why does one screen reader respond differently than another to the same ARIA markup?</i> The answer is that ARIA is mapped to platform-specific accessibility APIs, which vary across operating systems. Additionally, each assistive technology vendor can choose how (or whether) to interpret any ARIA attribute. This leads to a somewhat inconsistent, patchwork experience across devices and browsers.")

ARIA provides a way to communicate these changes to assistive technologies through live regions. However, live regions should be used with caution. If implemented incorrectly or overused, they can create a frustrating experience by repeatedly interrupting the user with constant updates. In some cases, such as for users of braille displays, the device might not even relay the notification. For these and other reasons, live regions can be very useful but must be applied carefully and thoughtfully.")
        section:AddParagraph("With that caution in mind, ARIA live regions include several properties that control how updates are communicated to users. The aria-live property, in particular, determines how forcefully dynamic content should be announced. It can take the following values:")
