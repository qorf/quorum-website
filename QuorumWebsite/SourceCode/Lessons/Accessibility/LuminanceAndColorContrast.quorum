To even understand the debate, however, <strong>requires</strong> some math.")

The text luminance (0.167) and the background luminance (1.0) are both above the threshold of 0.022, which means they do not require clamping. Therefore, you can now evaluate the polarity and compute the raw contrast signal for the two luminances. To do this, first check if the absolute value of the difference is above the perceptual input threshold of 0.0005. It is, so now you can check the polarity; remember if the luminance of the background is greater than the luminance of the text, it is considered normal polarity:")
