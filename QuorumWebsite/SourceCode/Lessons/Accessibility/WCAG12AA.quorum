        Maybe the elements of the page were broken, missing, or out of place. 
        For many people trying to use the web, this frustration can be all too common. 
        When designing an experience for a user, it is important that it is accessible on a technical level, such as providing alt text on images. 
        To be reasonably accessible, a user needs to be able to use, distinguish, and understand the content you want to show them. Consider color for a moment. What causes colors to have sufficient, or not enough, contrast?")

WCAG is designed to help people with varying levels of abilities, and as you increase the level of conformance, the guidelines start to address issues with usability to be as universal as possible. ")
        section:AddParagraph("Level A addresses some of the needs that must be met to have the most basic level of accessibility. An example of this is adding alt text to images. Without alt text, the image and content in the image would be considered inaccessible because there is no information provided to convey that content to users that need this kind of perception. Without meeting the criteria at Level A, a web page would be considered inaccessible or have a major barrier. To meet Level AA conformance, you must also meet Level A.")
        section:AddParagraph("Level AA, on the other hand, is where the guidelines address important but more nuanced accessibility barriers. Level AA is the most common target standard for legal and practical compliance. It is a mid-range between the basic necessities for accessibility and the practicality of achieving certain aspects of accessibility. Level AAA is the highest level of conformance WCAG has, which includes some very specific pieces. This level is not the usual target for accessibility because it contains guidelines that are not achievable or practical for certain types of content.")
        section:AddParagraph("An example of this is the criterion in Level AAA that says to use language at a lower secondary education level. This might not be possible for certain legal or technical content. While using simpler language might be a good goal to aim for, since content may be more understandable at that reading level, it cannot be expected for all content to meet it. Another consideration is that organizations will always try to weigh the cost and effort to implement a requirement and how much users will benefit from it. For example, while having sign language on videos, a AAA requirement, is excellent, a requirement for all possible products would drastically balloon the cost in creating it. It is also not clear it is always necessary, compared to captions, although this is subjective. ")
        section:AddParagraph("While Level AAA might not be the typical legal or practical goal, it does provide interesting ideas, and the improvements to usability for certain people might be significant.

Guidelines <i>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</i> and <i>1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</i> define a ratio between text color, background color, and color in graphical objects. These criteria aim to address issues distinguishing content on a webpage.") 
        section:AddParagraph("One might imagine color contrast impacts certain people and not others. For example, it is certainly true that contrast can impact those with color blindness. Contrast, however, is easily one of the more universal aspects of accessibility. Poor contrast makes text content hard to read for pretty much everyone. That said, many kinds of users, as they age, with color blindness, or other conditions, can be even more sensitive to issues of color. As a curious and interesting example, consider Rello and Bigham's paper on color contrast [1]. The study is complex and has lots of nuance, but the essential finding is that people with or without dyslexia have different reading performance with different colors, even with the same color contrast. The point is that it is important to think carefully before you presume you understand human perception of color.")
        section:AddParagraph("Importantly, to understand color contrast, you need to do so mathematically. While it would be nice to do this by feel, the math matters both from a regulatory perspective and from the perspective of understanding what is happening. Specifically, color contrast is calculated through the relative luminance of the colors, which is a measure of the perceived brightness of a color. This is calculated by taking the color and putting it into an equation. In the sRGB color space the equation looks like this:")

A higher contrast ratio would then mean that your eyes have an easier time distinguishing between two colors. But something to notice about this equation is that it does not take into account which color is the background and which is in the foreground. Therefore, you can swap background and foreground, and it would result in the same ratio.")
        
        AddHeading(section, "Color Contrast Limitations", 3)
        section:AddParagraph("Government standards in the U.S. and the EU use WCAG 2.2 as the standard. However, for many reasons relative luminance has its issues. In the current WCAG 3 draft, the color contrast guidelines follow a different model based on modern vision science, and how those equations work is covered in a future lesson [2].")
        section:AddParagraph("The intentions of the color contrast guidelines are good, but in cases where you might need many colors, such as a chart, there is a fundamental mathematical limitation where there are only so many possible colors you can use that meet the contrast ratio requirements. So while in some cases it might be easy to check color contrast on, like text color and the background, more complicated visual representations might need nuanced consideration.")
        section:AddParagraph("Consider an example. Suppose you have a chart where you have selected a corresponding regulatory contrast ratio between, say, elements of the bars. If this is so, and such a value is X, then it must be the case that the distinguishing pieces of the visualization, no matter what they are, must be the floor of the maximum contrast divided by the threshold, or 21 / X. In a specific case, if there were 6 bars in a barchart that all needed a threshold of 3, you could have 6 bars. There are many, many ways around issues like this, but the point is that color and color contrast has very real, and very limited, ratios of design play.")
        section:AddParagraph("There are also other requirements in 1AA that are affected by the responsiveness of the page, such as orientation, text resizing, and the need to scroll to access all content. A key takeaway is that there is a wide range of devices a user might use, and it may not be possible to predict how a user might manipulate the content for their personal use. For example, a user with low vision might increase the text size because larger text may be easier to read. Therefore, from a design perspective, it may be a good idea to assess what happens to your content if the text size is magnified.")

While a user is navigating, especially on a keyboard or tablet, it is important they can find where they are and where they can go. Headings and labels help a user understand what they are viewing or focused on. Headings help users move around the page efficiently, especially those using a screen reader. Furthermore, users tend to have a preferred way of finding pages they need, so content with a large number of pages might have a search bar or a table of contents to help find different pages.")
        section:AddParagraph("Another feature that helps users navigate is a visible focus. You might notice that many controls on the web change appearance when they are active, such as a textbox that highlights when you start typing in it. For sighted keyboard users, this visual indicator is essential for knowing where they are on the page.")
        section:AddParagraph("Screen readers also draw a focus box around certain objects when they are selected. This makes it important to define bounding boxes correctly, as screen readers may use this information to visually indicate the area of focus.
