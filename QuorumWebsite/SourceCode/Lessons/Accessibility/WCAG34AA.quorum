        section:AddParagraph("The AA sections of WCAG in 3 and 4 are relatively light and need, arguably, less attention to figure out. At the heart of this area of WCAG is a simple idea, which is to leave things alone unless they need change. For example, imagine a website where on every page, there was a different navigation and layout. This would be annoying and all WCAG is really saying is not to do that. Of course, the real guidance uses different words, but the idea is pretty simple. As such, having consistent navigation and labeling is a big portion of this section.")   
        section:AddParagraph("Past the former, there are two different portions of WCAG that are interesting in this section, although they only apply in certain situations. The first is legal documents. Modern tools like DocuSign or others have signatures that are legally binding. WCAG is essentially arguing that some care should be applied when dealing with serious matters like banking or legal.")
        section:AddParagraph("Past legal documents, section 3.3.8 is new to WCAG 2.2 and is on accessible authentication. Consider a tangible example related to authentication that seems to not just break this new rule, but so many others: the now defunct virtual keyboard from treasury direct. Treasury Direct is a website run by the U.S. Department of the treasury that for many years had a rather odd mechanism to log into its website. Notably, instead of a password field, it would display to the user a virtual keyboard where you type keys with the mouse.")

Yes, this system broke the website for people with disabilities in a variety of ways, but it does not take a convincing empirical study to grasp that this was a poor design for everyone.")
        section:AddParagraph("As a secondary point, consider 3.3.8 in this context. In addition to many other WCAG rules, this violates this newer section because it breaks password managers. In other words, for your own work the idea is that you should not design a website where you make it difficult or impossible for tools like password managers to fill things in for users. In the very unusual instance where you might have to break such tools, alternative designs that remove the cognitive function test are important.")

The key takeaway is that if there is an error, the user should get some idea about what to do about the error and how to prevent it in the future. In computer science, where things like compiler errors are common but not always easy to understand, keep in mind that perfect is the enemy of the good. These rules do not change the reality that mathematical limitations around errors may be real. It is just asking you to try and be reasonable about telling the user information they need.")

        section:AddParagraph("Consider an example related to the section 4AA criterion at Level AA. Status messages are messages that do not take you away from the content you are currently on, but provide information you may want to know. WCAG suggests using one of the roles, status or alert, but does not discuss the pros and cons of  giving a dynamic attribute to a region. In fact, when discussing this issue with developers, a typical instinct is to put this information into what is called a live region.")
        section:AddParagraph("An ARIA live region is a HTML element that notifies accessibility technologies about changes in the content of the element. Live regions are capable of alerting the user to any status updates, but not moving the keyboard focus.")

A polite region, as seen in the example above, waits to announce a change until the screen reader finishes its current dialogue, whereas an assertive region announces the change immediately, even if it interrupts ongoing speech.")
        section:AddParagraph("While it is important for users to be informed of changes in dynamic elements, this WCAG criterion does not provide guidance on when to use different types of live regions, nor does it address some of their potential drawbacks. Exactly the right approach is arguable, but caution is appropriate. Using live regions in general is appropriate sometimes, but sparingly is key. Further, only use aggressive ones if you have a very good reason. Even if you think you have a good reason, you should second guess whether it is really true.")
        section:AddParagraph("Consider a more direct example. You might have visited a site with so much visual clutter that it was hard to understand. This same idea can apply to users who rely on touch or audio. If used incorrectly, a live region can trigger too frequently and become overwhelming. When you do need to announce an update, it must be meaningful, timely, and relevant, otherwise, it will create a bad user experience. In many ways, when and when not to use these and in what way is a judgment call.")
        section:AddParagraph("Another consideration with live regions is that each screen reader may handle them differently. Timing, phrasing, and even whether the update is announced at all can vary between screen readers, operating systems and browsers. Braille devices, in particular, may differ significantly, as a dynamic update can be disruptive for a braille user. In a case like this, a live region might reduce usability, or the user might miss information that a screen reader user would have received. Put another way, even if you say assertive, it may not even work how you intend and what you intend may not make sense anyway.")
