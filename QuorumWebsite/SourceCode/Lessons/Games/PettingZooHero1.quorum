AddHeading(section, "Real-Time and Turn-Based Games", 3)
section:AddParagraph("Although parts of the code for Sky Hopper and Petting Zoo Hero are similar, the games themselves are very different. One of the core differences is the timing in gameplay. Sky Hopper is what is known as a real-time game. The player actively controls the character and the game immediately reacts. The game does not wait for the player, but is always moving. For example, gravity is always pulling the player, whether the player is acting or not.")
section:AddParagraph("Petting Zoo Hero is a turn-based game. Like a board game, the players (or in this case, the player and the computer) take turns doing things in the game. The player can take as much time as they want to figure out their next move, and the computer will wait patiently. ")
section:AddParagraph("Because of this difference, the two games play very differently, and they test different skills. A real-time game is often a test of reflexes and quick thinking. Making the game fun is about presenting obstacles and challenges that will make the player think on their feet and react. Meanwhile, turn-based games are more like puzzles. The player has all the time in the world to make their decisions, so the fun comes from finding the right decisions to make. ")
section:AddParagraph("This also means the games might appeal to different players for different reasons. One player might enjoy turn-based games because they have time to stop and think, while another player might dislike them because they feel they are slow.")
section:AddParagraph("These differences also have big impacts on accessibility. In order to make a real-time game accessible, information must be presented quickly enough it can be reacted to. For a turn-based game, the player has more time to consider the information. That does not mean that the turn-based game is automatically more accessible, though. A good puzzle might need lots of pieces, which might be harder to navigate or understand. Exactly what accessibility means for games is sometimes not entirely obvious. If the game is too easy then you have an I win button. If it is too hard, this may not be fun either.")

section:AddParagraph("Grid coordinates are a system where positions map to cells of a grid. Grid coordinates are measured from the bottom left corner, just like pixel coordinates. Importantly, in computer science, items are often zero-indexed, a fancy way of saying that counting begins at 0, not at 1. That means the first cell in a row or column is at position 0.")

The box also has a name written on it, so you can tell different boxes apart. This name works kind of like a shape, where not all shapes can fit in all boxes.")

The first box reads integer, which describes the type of information that can be stored in the variable. The second box reads a, which is the variable’s name. After the second box is an equal sign, which indicates assignment (a fancy term for putting something in the variable box). The last box reads 0, which is the value of the variable, or in other words, the data being put in the box. For screen reader users, note that this type, name, value terminology is embedded into the screen reader cues, but varies slightly depending on platform and which screen reader is used. In the image above it is also displayed, which only occurs if the cursor is in a field and not the block. Integers are whole numbers without a decimal point. ")
        
        
        
AddHeading(section, "Integer Operators", 3)
section:AddParagraph("While programming, you often need to use math to run calculations. Fortunately, the operators typically taught in school are largely very similar to what programming languages do. The kind of operators you can use, and what they do depends on the data type. ")
section:AddParagraph("The operators described here all work in the same way. One value is placed on the left, another on the right, and an operator is placed in the middle. For integers, consider that 1 + 2 is a mathematical expression with the plus operator placed between the integers 1 and 2. The expression calculates how you might expect, with an answer of 3.")
section:AddParagraph("For <strong>integers</strong>, you can use the five basic operations of math: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/). Integers also have modulus (mod), which calculates the remainder after integer division.")
section:AddParagraph("In the problems for this lesson, you will do operations like changing the values of your integer variables or making math expressions in each using operators to calculate a new value. It might be as follows:")
        
section:Add(preformatter:GeneratePreformattedCode(
"integer wholeNumber = 7 + 5
number decimalNumber = 10.0 / 4.0"))
        
section:AddParagraph("Perhaps the trickiest detail to understand about integers and numbers is how they manage their answers. With integer values, since they do not have decimal points, an equation like 5 / 4 would have a result of 1, not 1.25, and a remainder (called mod) of 1. This might sound like a mistake, but being able to obtain the number of times the divisor goes into the numerator is important in computer science for many kinds of apps. Chopping off the end of the value here is sometimes called truncating. Another word for the same idea is taking the floor.")
        
AddHeading(section, "Loops", 3)
section:AddParagraph("When making programs, you often want to run code multiple times. Sometimes it is more convenient to run the same code over and over again instead of writing out duplicate code by hand. In other cases, you do not know ahead of time how many times the code will need to run. This can be used for a seemingly endless, pun intended, number of reasons, like counting, adding, or other operations. For example, in Petting Zoo Hero, you might find that manually adding animals to many cells in the grid quickly gets tedious – the ability to run code repeatedly could make this faster and easier. ")
section:AddParagraph("In computer science, there are many ways to accomplish this, and programming languages vary in how they describe it. In Quorum specifically, the word repeat is used to imply the concept in the computer of doing something over and over again. While the exact terms vary across the discipline, sometimes these structures are known as loops.")
section:AddParagraph("A <strong>loop</strong> is a section of code with a condition attached to it. That condition is usually either a number of times to run, such as 'do this code 10 times,' or it is a boolean value. If the condition is true, then the loop keeps going. If it is not, then the loop stops.")

The basic idea is that things inside of a scope only 
execute under certain conditions. Consider what these three 
lines of code do.")

Blocks like this will run any code inside of it as many times as requested. In the program above, for example, the block will run its code two times. This means that the output block will run twice and thus put words on the screen twice.")
