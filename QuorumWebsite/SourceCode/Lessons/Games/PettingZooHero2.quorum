For example, gentle music or bright backgrounds might suggest that a level is intended to be easy or relaxing. On the other hand, energetic music or ominous backgrounds might suggest a challenge. In this way, these artistic additions allow you to express yourself in the game’s design and communicate intent to a player.

To get this line of code, you can either type it by hand in a blank block, or you can modify the block after adding it from the palette. To do that, select the block (not a field inside of it), and press the right arrow. This will turn the block into a blank block you can modify, and add the extra text to the left side. Inside the editor, there is also an automatic hint that will do this on its own, which you can use the hotkey ALT + ENTER for.")

These also have different attributes, with different levels of flavor (how effective they are at feeding animals), push-back, and cost. Treats are your primary tool for completing levels.")

section:AddParagraph("Overall, to round out the discussion with Petting Zoo Hero, consider that that number of adjustments you can make is somewhat smaller than in SkyHopper. However, that is because in a puzzle game, the core of the idea is you are constructing interesting puzzles on the grid. There is no gravity or obstacles or other items, but there are collections of animals and treats that you can adjust. Consider thinking back to SkyHopper for a moment and considering what additional options exist there.")
        
AddHeading(section, "Obstacles in Sky Hopper", 3)

AddHeading(section, "Keys", 4)
section:AddParagraph("By default, the player only needs to reach the exit goal to beat a level. You may decide, however, that you want the player to have to work a little harder to leave. This is where keys come in.")
section:AddParagraph("If you add keys to a level, the exit door will be locked. Players must collect all keys on a level in order to open the goal door. When you add keys to a level, they must be positioned on the screen using pixel coordinates. Here is an example:")

AddHeading(section, "Bouncers", 4)
section:AddParagraph("Bouncers let you introduce a little extra physics-based chaos to the game. They are circular obstacles that will push the player away if touched. These can be used to get in the way, or they can be used like trampolines to launch the player to new areas.")

"level1:AddBouncer(300, 100)
level1:AddBouncer(600, 100, 1000)"))
section:AddParagraph("The example above adds two bouncers. The first two numbers are pixel coordinates placing the bouncers. On the second line of code, a third number is provided, 800. This sets the pushing force of the bouncer. If you try adding these two lines to a level, you will see one of these pushes a lot harder than the other.")
        
AddHeading(section, "Portals", 4)
section:AddParagraph("Just like bouncers can either help or hinder the player, you can use portals to transport the player somewhere. Whether that location is good or devious is up to you. When you create a portal, you provide two sets of pixel coordinates. The first set is where the portal is positioned on the screen. The second set is where the player will be teleported if they touch the portal. Here is an example:")
section:Add(preformatter:GeneratePreformattedCode(
"level1:AddPortal(150, 25, 600, 700)"))
        
AddHeading(section, "Moving Objects", 4)
section:AddParagraph("Many platformer games contain moving platforms or obstacles. You can do the same in Sky Hopper.  Platforms, Bouncers, and Portals can all be turned into moving objects by adding waypoints. When an object has waypoints, it will move from its starting position to the first waypoint, then the second, etc., until it has moved to the last one. Then, it will go backwards through the points until it returns to the start position, then it repeats. ")
section:AddParagraph("To do this, you will need to modify an object, similar to how you can modify items in Petting Zoo Hero. Here is an example:")
section:Add(preformatter:GeneratePreformattedCode(
"Platform platform = level1:AddShortPlatform(150, 150)
platform:AddWaypoint(150, 400)"))
section:AddParagraph("This example makes a platform move up and down, like an elevator. You can also make platforms move left and right. Be careful though: platforms are slippery. They will not carry a player along. You might need to run to keep up.")
        
AddHeading(section, "Colors and Libraries", 3)
section:AddParagraph("You may have noticed while exploring Sky Hopper that there are some places where you can use Colors, such as Level’s SetPlatformColor action. In order to use Colors, you will need to bring in some extra code from elsewhere using a Library. This is the same thing you have already seen at the top of the template files, the lines of code that start with use.")
section:AddParagraph("Libraries are pieces of code written and stored away by someone for future use. They can be used to solve specific problems or provide certain tools, which can be reused later by anyone who needs them. In this case, we will use a library that provides code for using colors.")
section:AddParagraph("To use colors, you need to add a new line of code to the top of the file:")
        
section:Add(preformatter:GeneratePreformattedCode(
"use Libraries.Game.Graphics.Color"))
section:AddParagraph("This will let you make a new kind of Object, Color objects. Color objects create colors by mixing red, green, and blue components, along with a fourth opacity (or transparency) value. Each component is treated as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 means that color is absent, and 1 means that color is fully present.")
section:AddParagraph("For example, this line of code uses four values, for red, green, blue, and opacity, respectively. It will produce yellow by mixing red and green, leaving out blue, and making it fully opaque. Then, it makes it the default color of platforms on a level:")
section:Add(preformatter:GeneratePreformattedCode(
"Color yellow
yellow:SetColor(1, 1, 0, 1)
level1:SetPlatformColor(yellow)"))
        
AddHeading(section, "Generating Random Numbers", 3)
section:AddParagraph("You can also use a library to produce random numbers. Randomness is used often in computer games to introduce elements of luck or unpredictability, or to make games feel different when played multiple times. You might consider using it to produce random coordinates where platforms will be placed in Sky Hopper, or to place animals at random coordinates on the grid in Petting Zoo Hero.")
section:AddParagraph("To use the Random library, you will need to add this line of code to the top of the file:")
        
section:Add(preformatter:GeneratePreformattedCode(
"use Libraries.Compute.Random"))
section:AddParagraph("The Random library can produce random numbers in several ways, which you can explore using the Advice pane. The simplest way is to generate an integer between two values. For example, this code will generate an integer between 0 and 10:")
section:Add(preformatter:GeneratePreformattedCode(
"Random generator
generator:RandomIntegerBetween(0, 10)"))
        
AddHeading(section, "User Testing", 3)
section:AddParagraph("While the templates contain many tools for creating games, it is up to you to decide how you want to design your game. Designing a game can be difficult, and making something fun is far from an exact science. One common approach is to perform user testing.")
section:AddParagraph("The concept of user testing is implied by the name. You make something, then show it to people and have them try it out. However, there are some common sense things to consider when having people try out your games.")
section:AddParagraph("First, when people use your game, do not help them. This sounds counterintuitive, but your goal is not to play the game for them. Sit back, observe, and see how it goes. If the user gets stuck, let them try to figure it out on their own. Sometimes this can be frustrating to observe because what is obvious to you may not be to them.")
section:AddParagraph("Second, give your user some goals. Just telling a user to play might be ok in some games, but perhaps not with others. Generally, it is a good idea to give the user some rough goals, especially around the areas of the game that you think need testing. A bit of guidance can go a long way. With your games this might be as simple as saying to get the key and find the door. Or for your puzzle, it might be to tell them to see if they can defeat a level without losing any hitpoints.")
section:AddParagraph("Third, consider using a talk aloud protocol. In this case, if a user is using your content, it is ok to ask them questions or ask them to describe what they are doing, where they are struggling, or how they are feeling. This kind of approach is imperfect, but can be helpful in hammering out ideas.")
section:AddParagraph("Finally, although it sounds silly, be sure not to 
violate the most important rule of user testing: <strong>be kind</strong>. 
When people come to help you find problems in their game, be nice to them when 
they find them. This is especially important because user testing can be 
frustrating on both sides. For the game programmer, the user might find important 
issues. For the user, they might run into bugs or frustrating parts in the game. 
A bit of kindness goes a long way.

However, instead of programming your prototype at first, you are going to engage in a special kind of user testing called Wizard of Oz prototyping.")
section:AddParagraph("Wizard of Oz prototyping is a common technique used in computer science and has been around since it was coined by J.F. Kelley [1]. The basic idea is simple. Instead of fully creating your game, with all the media and time it takes to do so, fake it and have people try versions as you go.")

You may choose to include ideas from when you previously explored or you might start fresh. Stay off the computer for a while and design your prototype on paper, with push pins, or with physical objects. The idea is to play around both with how your levels could be designed while exploring the benefits and limitations of Wizard of Oz prototyping. The point is to design your level first, then try and code it up.")
section:AddParagraph("To give a few ideas on how you can do such testing, consider some options. For Petting Zoo Hero, you might consider finding a checkers or a chess board and using that to play around with ideas for your grid. For SkyHopper, you might cut out pieces of paper and place them in an arrangement to design various platform puzzles. This might give you estimates of pixels.")
section:AddParagraph("What you build here may or may not be part of your final design. The goal is to try things, mess around, and get some ideas so you can code them up. Once your prototype is ready, work with a partner to test each other’s levels. This can be informal, but more specific feedback is usually more helpful than less.")
section:AddParagraph("As a partner is using your prototype, ask their opinion on the design of the levels and what they think should change in the design of the game. Once you have had another user try your game and give some feedback, it is time to get hacking. Good luck!")
