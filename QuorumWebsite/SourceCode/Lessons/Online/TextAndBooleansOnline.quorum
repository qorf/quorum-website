Traditional approaches that make use of graphics vary and include ideas like drag and drop, animated characters, scientific visualization to represent data, 2D or 3D game programming, or many other ideas. This can be fun, compelling, and interesting, but has historically had one clear flaw: they were not always accessible to people with disabilities. In this exploration section, you will be exploring and tinkering with an online programming environment (IDE) designed with a new design philosophy sometimes called Accessible Graphics. While the term can be interpreted in many ways, in this context the big idea is to keep the graphics and the fun, to the greatest extent that is reasonable, and be as inclusive as possible.")
        section:AddParagraph("Before thinking about how to use such environments, it helps to consider 
whether block environments should be used at all. After all, professional programmers, near 
exclusively, use text and only text based environments to code. Beginners, typically in or 
before high school, tend to use so-called 'block' environments. A common block environment 
students may have been previously exposed to would be <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu'>MIT’s Scratch</a>, although there are many others. The bottom line in academic research is that block environments do tend to help people learn, but those gains tend to be small and rather short lived [2]. Students typically use them only for a few weeks. Further, if that learning is freeform, meaning students tinker with minimal or no guidance, it may not lead to positive learning outcomes [1]. Put another way, blocks are somewhat helpful to learners, but they are not magic and students need direction.")

        section:AddParagraph("In this explore section, the next step is to think about how to use blocks. You will explore, optionally, using several possible affordances, including the mouse, the keyboard, and a screen reader and will continue to use online coding tools. As a first step, consider what happens if you drag or use the keyboard to put multiple blocks into the environment, including at least one that has a beginning and an end. Here is an example of an output and say statement. This might appear as follows:")

Textboxes can have multiple lines. The horizontal cursor indicates the line you are on. It provides a visual indicator for users, but also maps to accessibility technologies under the hood so they can obtain the same information. Moving up and down in the editor changes the cursor. If you use blocks offline instead of online, it may also update the user interface to provide more advanced information on the code you are writing. Online, however, you are writing code with Parsons problems, which means examples designed for learning.")

        AddHeading(section, "Blank Blocks", 3)
section:AddParagraph("While the tray is a primary way of adding blocks, especially for young users, evidence in the academic literature suggests novices only use blocks for a short time, generally a few weeks [2]. Past this time, learning benefits drop off, compared to text, although the literature is limited in the sense that little longitudinal tracking exists. In the Quorum programming language, however, lines of code are identical to blocks, which means you can turn it on or off. If you like the blocks, just use them as you see fit. If you choose to just use text, you will interact with the code differently but will be learning exactly the same computer science concepts and code. You can think about it kind of like having spellcheck on or off.")
section:AddParagraph("An example of this text and block equivalency is the 'blank block.' Literally, when Quorum Blocks reads the code, it asks itself what the code should look, sound, and feel like. For example, if a normal text editor had a blank line of code, it would be drawn on the screen as a blank line. If the blocks are on, Quorum draws a little box instead. This is true for all possible Quorum code. ")
section:AddParagraph("For interacting with the environment, while students can use the mouse, similar functionality is available through the keyboard. Blocks can be used forever, for any possible program and the blank blocks help by allowing novices to use the tray or the visual as they see fit. You can add a blank block by pressing the Enter key and can think of it as a temporary place where you can write in text for a short time. In text, the blank block is the same as an empty line of code.")

In an online editor for Quorum Blocks, only light mode is available at the time of this writing. In saying that it is the same as a blank line of code, that is again meant literally. When Quorum reads your source code, if it sees a blank line, it knows that this means a blank block and thus shows a picture of this visually, while also sending information to the operating system for accessibility. If you instead pulled up the code in a text editor, it would visually display it differently but would be the same code under the hood. From this perspective, since blocks are just a visual on top of exactly the same code, both novices and professionals can use the blocks as a choice if they wish. The vertical cursor inside of a blank block allows the user to write a raw line of code, from memory, which provides a form of a text mode without losing all of the benefits of a full switch between a text or blocks style mode. Put another way, if you already know what kind of code you want to write, you can just write it and ignore the blocks without turning them off completely if you choose.")

They can also use the logical operators <strong>and</strong> and <strong>or</strong> to combine values. The and operator produces the boolean value <strong>true</strong> only if both the left and right value are also true, or produces <strong>false</strong> if either of them are false. The or operator produces the boolean value true if at least one of the two values are true, and only produces false if both values are false. The concept is similar to the concept of a truth table.")

"boolean myBooleanValue = true or false"))
section:AddParagraph("It might seem odd to have such a collection of operators for just the concept of true or false. The reason is because telling the computer you want it to constrain your code allows it to check for mistakes automatically. For example, if you are working on code to represent a light switch and you know for sure that the computer will always check to make sure it can only be on or off before you even run your code, then you can never make this mistake.
