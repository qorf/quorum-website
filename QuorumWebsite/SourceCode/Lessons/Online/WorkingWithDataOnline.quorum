In some sense, data science is like computer science, except with a greater focus on statistics formulas and visualizations. In some sense it is a bit formal, including trying to understand complicated probabilities and equations. In another, most of the time when actually doing data science, the computer manages a great deal of the math for you and the job is more around interpretation of what the data means. As of the time of this writing, there are no unified and agreed upon standards for what data science really is, or what should be taught, although many groups are putting on their thinking caps [1].
")
section:AddParagraph("While learning about data science is a big and complicated topic, this lesson will give you practice in exploring some of the basics.

The contents of this data are arbitrary, however it is important to recognize what a common CSV file may look like.

")
section:AddParagraph("One important point with Tidy is that not all kinds of data can be stored this way in computer science. Sometimes the amount of data is so large that you need specialized approaches to reduce space. For example, storing the social network for all people on earth or storing temperature data at small increments for generations, takes orders of magnitude more space than is typically required for much data science work. The point is that Tidy data is useful, but the rabbit hole can go deep. It is an extremely useful approach and will work for a great deal of projects, but not all.

A DataFrame is a series of rows and columns, like a table or spreadsheet, except stored in the computer's memory in a picky way. DataFrame objects can contain many kinds of things. For example, one column might contain text, another might contain numbers, and another might contain integers. DataFrames can have selections, kind of like selecting a row or column in a spreadsheet, and can do operations on top of that selection.

In the offline editor, if you place DataFrame frame, or some other name, into the editor, you can then press ALT+ENTER to have it automatically find the appropriate use statement. You can also right click, or use a keyboard shortcut for your operating system, to pull up the context menu, to have it insert the right line of code. 
")
section:AddParagraph("The online editor has a different purpose and thus works differently. Crucially, the kinds of automatic hints that generate the appropriate use statement are not included in the online editor, so keys like ALT+ENTER would not do anything. This is not an accident. The purpose of the online editor is for learning. Although any valid code can be used in the editor, the tray limits the options to reduce the search space of ideas to think about as you code. Keep in mind that no matter how a use statement is placed in the editor, whether through typing, a hint, or the tray, the result is the same. The use statement gives access to the library that you want.

The actual action you want would be AddSelectedColumn(n) where n is the column index you are adding.
")
section:AddParagraph("There are two ways to add a selected column to the selection list in DataFrame. One approach is to add it by an index, starting at 0, which is from the left hand side in a spreadsheet. The other is to use its name, which is the value in the first row of the file. As a non-obvious rule, this name may not contain spaces. You may also select a range of columns using AddSelectedColumnRange(n,n) where the n-parameters indicate the column index ranges you are trying to add.
