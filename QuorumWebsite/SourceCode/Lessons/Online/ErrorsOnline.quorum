        section:AddParagraph("Computer programming languages can take practice to learn and an important part of that practice is learning about errors. When people think of the idea of an error, it often has a bad connotation. Perhaps a person feels subjectively bad for making an error or is frustrated in trying to fix it. 
")
section:AddParagraph("In practice, however, while certain kinds of mistakes are harder to fix in programming than others, the good news is that humans are quite predictable. Some errors are so commonplace that the computer can take a good reasonable guess about how to fix them on its own. As a programmer, recognizing these mistakes and understanding why they occur will strengthen your problem solving skills and help you learn to invent more complex programs.
")
section:AddParagraph("While the word mistake is common in English, in computer science you typically break down the concept into kinds. The most common two are compiler errors and runtime errors. Consider an example of both.
")
        
        
AddHeading(section, "Compiler Error", 3)
section:AddParagraph("Programming languages are complicated bits of technology. You might think of them as turning human-like language into 1s and 0s, which in a literal sense they do. Programming languages are made for people to be able to do this as easily as is reasonable. The basic problem though is this: what words or symbols are precise enough for a machine, yet understandable enough for a human?
")
section:AddParagraph("This question observes the natural mismatch between humans and machines. Computers are perfectly fine getting 0s and 1s for their programs, but this would be incomprehensible for people. The problem is made worse by the fact that machines have to process this text for humans, interpret it, then reorganize it to be converted into those 1s and 0s. This process is known as compiling. Along the way, many kinds of errors can happen. One such category of errors, called compiler errors, are those errors that can happen before a program ever runs. 
")
section:AddParagraph("Intuitively, you might think compiler errors are bad or frustrating, because they stop your program from running. In practice, however, humans have a love/hate relationship with compiler errors. They represent a situation where the computer can calculate that, with mathematical certainty, your program may never run correctly and they can tell you that in advance. Because of this behind the scenes math, it also means they can often give you a reasonable guess, and location, for where the problem is. 
")
        
AddHeading(section, "Common Compiler Errors", 3)
section:AddParagraph("There are many kinds of compiler errors and one easy way to understand it is to think through which ones are common. It is tempting to just guess, but academic research has shown that the issue really needs evidence to understand. One recent overview of what is known was conducted by Becker et. al [1] and an overview of which errors are common amongst students was conducted by Altadmri and Brown [2]. One easy way to think about them is that, if you have errors in your code, to start by fixing the first and ignoring the rest [3]. Such a strategy is not perfect, but is often helpful.
")
section:AddParagraph("Consider an example with an output statement:
")

section:AddParagraph("First, notice that the system is being asked to output the word Hello, except that text requires a double quote on the left and the right hand side of the system. In this case, the right hand side is missing. One of the most common errors is mismatched braces [1, 2]. This is not exactly like, but is analogous to, this situation. In this system, typing this as raw text would then give the following:
")

section:AddParagraph("Part of the problem is that computer programming languages are not always very good at predicting what a human did wrong. In this case, the error message is stating that the word Hello with only a single left double quote is not a valid expression, which is true but confusing. How to make such messages better, and for whom, is an active line of research in computer science. 
")

section:AddParagraph("Even in block languages, it is a common misconception that no errors can be made. The errors are just shown differently and constrained in different ways. In some cases the language is constrained to the point that, while it is true some errors are impossible, many kinds of programs cannot be written. 
")
        
AddHeading(section, "Runtime Errors", 3)
section:AddParagraph("Sometimes errors can happen while the code seems to be working perfectly fine. Runtime errors are different from compiler errors. Instead of a program failing before it runs at all, the computer has identified that the source code is valid. It cannot, and in fact it is impossible to, know for sure your program is correct, but it can at least know that the source code looks like valid source in the programming language. 
")
section:AddParagraph("The problem is, not all source code gives useful results. Consider an example, which might look as so:
")
section:Add(preformatter:GeneratePreformattedCode(
"output 5 / 0"))
section:AddParagraph("This code, whether typed as raw text or placed into a block, is valid and correct. The computer programming language sees that it is a valid line of code. The problem is, what does a computer program do if you divide by zero? In almost all programming languages, the answer is that it crashes your program. However, when running on the web, it does something funny: it returns infinity. The reason is cryptic and historical, coming from a strange specification in the 1980s called IEEE 754-1985. Because, when you run code online, although you can kind of sort of get around it, you are stuck with this standard, when you run Quorum in the browser this is the behavior you get. 
")
section:AddParagraph("To make this more confusing, if you were to run Quorum offline in Quorum studio, where the environment is more strict about math, you would be given a weird looking error, like so:
")
section:Add(preformatter:GeneratePreformattedCode(
"Error: class java.lang.ArithmeticException, / by zero
   file: Main.quorum,  class: Main,  action: Main,  line: 1
"))
section:AddParagraph("The details of what this means are out of scope, but the bottom line is that when a computer program is running, offline it crashes with a cryptic error. Online, it keeps running but tells you the operation was infinity, which is also cryptic. The point here is that computer science often has some pretty strange edge cases to manage.
")
section:AddParagraph("There are many kinds of runtime errors, for all sorts of situations, and you can even define your own. However, the crucial point to understand is that errors can happen before a program runs (compiler errors) and during a program's run (runtime error). Runtime errors are often called bugs and while not universally true, they are generally harder to find.
