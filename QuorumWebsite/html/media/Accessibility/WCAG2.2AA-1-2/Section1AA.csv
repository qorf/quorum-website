Guideline,Description
1.2.4 Captions (Live),"If the content is live, captions should also be created in real-time. While not perfect, automated systems have come a long way in creating high-quality real-time captions. "
1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded),A lot like 1.2.3 except instead of the option of having an alternative to the media the audio description is required.
1.3.4 Orientation,"Content is not restricted by a single orientation, such as portrait or landscape. Especially important for mobile devices."
1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose,"Input fields that require information from the user can be identified. For example you should be able to determine if a field is for a name, address, or other thing from tags on the field such as autocomplete."
1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum),"Unless it’s part of a logo or incidental, text needs to have a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. If the text is large it needs to be 3:1 or greater."
1.4.4 Resize Text,Text should be resizable. Modern web pages do this through responsive design.
1.4.5 Images of Text,Text should be used directly rather than a picture of text.
1.4.10 Reflow,Scrollable content can be shown and used without requiring scrolling in two dimensions. 
1.4.11 Non-text Contrast,Color in images should have a 3:1 contrast ratio. This could apply to many things but in some cases such as charts there are fundamental mathematical limitations.
1.4.12 Text Spacing,Changing text style properties should not result in loss of content or functionality.
1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus,Content that pops up should be dismissable by keyboard and mousing over it and off of it should not cause it to disappear.
