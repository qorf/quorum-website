Property,Information
Name,"The accessible name of the element, announced by screen readers. In this case, it’s Application, describing the menu bar."
ControlType,"Indicates the UI Automation role of the element. MenuBar (50010) tells us this is a container for top-level menu items like File, Edit, or View. UIA contains a lot of possible roles and you can refer to the full documentation to find the possible values of this property."
LocalizedControlType,"A human-readable and localized version of the control type, here displayed as ‘menu bar’."
IsKeyboardFocusable,Shows whether the element can receive keyboard focus. True means users can navigate to it using the keyboard. In the case of menu bars you typically will not reach them with the Tab key but on Windows the Alt key is how you reach menu bars. 
BoundingRectangle,"Defines the element’s position and dimensions on screen using screen coordinates (left, top, right, bottom). For example, [l=904, t=440, r=2448, b=459] describes a wide, horizontal strip. Screen readers have a feature that will draw a focus highlight around the focused element and the dimensions of that highlight are based on its bounding box. Accessibility Insights also draws a highlight to show the bounds visually. "
AccessKey,"A keyboard key (usually one character) that focuses or activates the element. Here, Alt activates the menu bar."
AcceleratorKey,A shortcut key combination that performs the control’s primary action directly. This property is not present in this case. You might find accelerator keys on the menu items attached to this menu bar. 
HelpText,Additional descriptive text or instructions meant for assistive technologies. Not present here.
