Error Type,Approximately what the Issue is
Mismatched Brace,"When an item in the language requires a human to match things left and right, they often miss one"
Calling functions incorrectly,"When using math functions, it is easy to accidentally send the function the wrong information"
Functions that give things back,"Some math functions give things back, like calculating a Sine function, Power, and when you write these it is easy to accidentally forget to give the answer back"
Equality Operators,"Some programming languages use two equal signs instead of one (== vs =) to ask the computer if two things are equal. Quorum does not work this way, but it would be a common error in some languages (e.g., Java, Python, C)"
